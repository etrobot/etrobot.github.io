Earlier this month, the electric-car maker Rivian announced its new SUV, the R2 — a $45,000 family hauler that will get more than 300 miles in range. It also debuted the R3 and R3X hatchbacks, which entranced online car nerds.<br>3. Rivian (RIVN) and Tesla (TSLA) shares are trading higher Monday afternoon following Rivian's announcement that its vehicles can now access Tesla's vast Supercharger network.
