## What to Watch for in US CPI Report

The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for March 2023 is due to be released on Wednesday, April 12. The CPI is a measure of inflation, which is the rate at which prices for goods and services are rising. Economists are expecting the CPI to show a rise of 0.4% in March, which would translate into an annual rate of inflation of 6.2%.

A higher-than-expected CPI reading could lead to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates more aggressively in an effort to cool inflation. A lower-than-expected CPI reading could ease concerns about inflation and lead to lower interest rates.

The article also includes a video of Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, discussing what to watch for in the CPI report. Zandi says that he expects the CPI to show a rise of 0.4% in March, which would translate into an annual rate of inflation of 6.2%. He says that the key factors to watch for in the report will be the prices of food, energy, and shelter.

Zandi says that the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points at its next meeting on May 3-4. However, he says that a higher-than-expected CPI reading could lead to the Fed raising interest rates by 0.5 percentage points.

Zandi says that the economy is still growing, but that the pace of growth is slowing. He says that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue raising interest rates until inflation starts to come down.

**Here are some key things to watch for in the CPI report:**

* The overall inflation rate
* The prices of food, energy, and shelter
* The prices of goods and services outside of food and energy
* The core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy prices

**What does the CPI report mean for the Federal Reserve?**

The CPI report will be closely watched by the Federal Reserve as it makes decisions about interest rates. A higher-than-expected CPI reading could lead the Fed to raise interest rates more aggressively in an effort to cool inflation. A lower-than-expected CPI reading could ease concerns about inflation and lead to lower interest rates.

The Federal Reserve is likely to continue raising interest rates until inflation starts to come down. However, the Fed will need to be careful not to raise interest rates too quickly, which could lead to a recession.
