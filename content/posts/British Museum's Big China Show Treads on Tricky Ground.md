## British Museum's China Exhibition Treads on Tricky Ground

The British Museum is hosting a major exhibition of Chinese art, but the show has been met with criticism from some Chinese scholars who say it does not do enough to address the country's colonial past.

The exhibition, titled "China: Through the Looking Glass," features more than 150 objects from the British Museum's collection, including paintings, sculptures, and ceramics. The show has been praised for its scale and ambition, but some Chinese scholars have accused the British Museum of whitewashing its colonial history.

One of the main criticisms is that the exhibition does not mention the fact that many of the objects on display were looted from China during the Opium Wars of the 19th century. The British Museum has defended the exhibition, saying that it is a "celebration of Chinese art" and that it does not seek to "rewrite history."

However, the criticism has led to calls for the British Museum to return the looted objects to China.

The British Museum's China exhibition is a timely reminder of the complex relationship between the two countries. The show is a celebration of Chinese art, but it also highlights the dark legacy of colonialism. It is a reminder that the past is never truly past, and that we must continue to grapple with its legacies.
