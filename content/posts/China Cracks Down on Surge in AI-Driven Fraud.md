## How to Protect Yourself from AI-Driven Fraud

In recent years, there has been a surge in AI-driven fraud. This type of fraud uses AI to create hyper-realistic content, such as videos and audio recordings, that can be difficult to distinguish from real. The fraudsters then use this content to impersonate real people, such as celebrities or government officials, and trick victims into handing over money.

Chinese authorities have cracked down on AI-driven fraud, arresting dozens of suspects. However, the authorities warn that the use of AI in fraud is becoming increasingly sophisticated and that people should be on the lookout for scams.

Here are some tips for protecting yourself from AI-driven fraud:

* **Be suspicious of any unsolicited emails or messages that ask for personal information or money.**
* **Never click on links or open attachments in emails or messages from people you don't know.**
* **Be careful about what information you share online, especially on social media.**
* **Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication for all of your online accounts.**
* **Be aware of the latest scams and fraud trends.**

By following these tips, you can help to protect yourself from AI-driven fraud.
