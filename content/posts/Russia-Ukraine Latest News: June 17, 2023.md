## Russia-Ukraine War Update: June 17, 2023

**Russian forces make gains in Donbas, but Ukrainian forces resist**

Russian forces have made gains in the eastern Donbas region, but Ukrainian forces are still putting up a strong resistance. The Russian military has captured the city of Severodonetsk and surrounding towns, but Ukrainian forces have held on to the city of Lysychansk. The battle for the Donbas is still ongoing.

**U.S. and allies provide billions in military aid to Ukraine**

The United States and its allies have provided billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, including artillery, tanks, and drones. This aid has helped Ukraine to resist the Russian invasion. However, it is unclear how long Ukraine can continue to fight without more aid.

**War has devastating impact on global economy**

The war in Ukraine has had a devastating impact on the global economy. The war has disrupted global trade and supply chains, which has led to higher prices for food and energy. This has had a negative impact on the global economy, and it is likely to continue to do so for some time.

**War leads to humanitarian crisis**

The war in Ukraine has led to a humanitarian crisis. Millions of people have been displaced from their homes, and many have been killed. The international community is providing humanitarian assistance to these people, but the need is great.

The war in Ukraine is a complex and evolving situation. It is difficult to predict how the war will end, but it is clear that it will have a lasting impact on Ukraine, Russia, and the world.
