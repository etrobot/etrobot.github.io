## Mammogram Recommendations for Women Under 50

Mammogram screening is a controversial topic, especially for women under 50. The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that women start getting mammograms at age 45, while the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that women start getting mammograms at age 50.

There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that the benefits of mammograms for women under 50 may not outweigh the risks. The risks of mammograms for women under 50 include false positives, which can lead to unnecessary biopsies, and overdiagnosis, which can lead to unnecessary treatment.

The benefits of mammograms for women under 50 are not as clear as they are for women over 50. In women over 50, mammograms have been shown to reduce the risk of death from breast cancer by about 20%. However, in women under 50, the benefits of mammograms are less clear.

The ACS and USPSTF are currently reviewing their recommendations for mammograms for women under 50. It is possible that these organizations will change their recommendations in the future.

In the meantime, women under 50 should talk to their doctor about their individual risk factors and make a decision about whether or not to get a mammogram based on their own personal circumstances.

**What do you think? Should the current recommendations for mammograms for women under 50 be changed?**
