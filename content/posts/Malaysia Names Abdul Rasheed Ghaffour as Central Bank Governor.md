## Malaysia Names Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour as Central Bank Governor

Malaysia has appointed Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour as the new governor of the central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia. Ghaffour is a career banker who has served in various senior positions at Bank Negara Malaysia, including as deputy governor. He is also a former chairman of the Securities Commission Malaysia. Ghaffour takes over from Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus, who has served as governor since 2016. Yunus is retiring after six years in the role.

Ghafour is a respected figure in the Malaysian financial sector and is seen as a safe pair of hands to lead Bank Negara Malaysia. He is expected to continue the central bank's focus on price stability and financial stability.

Here are some of the challenges that Ghaffour is likely to face as governor of Bank Negara Malaysia:

* The ongoing global economic slowdown, which is putting pressure on Malaysia's export-dependent economy.
* The rising cost of living, which is putting pressure on household budgets.
* The potential for a financial crisis in China, which could have a significant impact on the Malaysian economy.

Ghafour will need to use his experience and skills to navigate these challenges and ensure that the Malaysian economy remains stable.
