## Swiss Watch Exports to US Fall for First Time in Over Two Years

Swiss watch exports to the United States fell by 4.9% in April 2023, marking the first decline in more than two years. The decline comes as the US economy faces headwinds from inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain disruptions. Swiss watchmakers are also facing increased competition from luxury brands from other countries, such as Japan and China.

Despite the decline, Swiss watch exports remain strong overall, with sales up 10.5% in the first four months of 2023.

The article also quotes a number of watchmakers who are concerned about the slowdown in demand from the US market. Patek Philippe CEO Thierry Stern said that the company is "seeing a slowdown in the US," while Oris CEO Rolf Studer said that the US market is "not as strong as it used to be."

The decline in Swiss watch exports to the US is a sign that the luxury watch market is not immune to the economic challenges that are facing the global economy. However, Swiss watchmakers remain confident that the long-term demand for luxury watches is still strong.

### Reasons for the Decline

There are a number of reasons for the decline in Swiss watch exports to the US. These include:

* **Inflation:** Inflation is rising in the US, which is making it more expensive for consumers to buy luxury goods.
* **Rising interest rates:** Rising interest rates are making it more expensive for consumers to borrow money, which is also impacting demand for luxury goods.
* **Supply chain disruptions:** Supply chain disruptions have made it more difficult for Swiss watchmakers to get the components they need to make watches, which has led to shortages and higher prices.
* **Increased competition:** Swiss watchmakers are facing increased competition from luxury brands from other countries, such as Japan and China.

### What does the future hold?

It is too early to say what the long-term impact of the decline in Swiss watch exports to the US will be. However, Swiss watchmakers remain confident that the long-term demand for luxury watches is still strong. They are working to address the challenges they are facing, such as inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain disruptions. They are also investing in new technologies and marketing initiatives to attract new customers.

Only time will tell how successful Swiss watchmakers will be in addressing the challenges they are facing. However, they have a long history of success in the luxury watch market, and they are confident that they will be able to weather the current storm.
