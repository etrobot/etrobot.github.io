## China's PBOC May Cut Interest Rates

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is in focus this week as investors wait to see if the central bank will cut its one-year policy rate. Bloomberg Economics believes that the PBOC is likely to cut the rate by 25 basis points to 3.75% on June 15th. This would be the first rate cut since January 2021.

There are several reasons why the PBOC may be considering a rate cut. First, China's economy is slowing down. Growth in the first quarter of 2023 was 4.8%, down from 8.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Second, inflation in China is rising. Consumer prices rose 2.1% in May, the highest level in over two years. Third, the US Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, which is putting upward pressure on borrowing costs in China.

A rate cut by the PBOC would help to support economic growth and contain inflation. It would also make Chinese exports more competitive in global markets. However, a rate cut could also lead to capital outflows from China and a weaker yuan.

The PBOC is likely to weigh the risks and benefits of a rate cut before making a decision. However, the consensus among economists is that the PBOC will cut the rate on June 15th.
