## ECB's Visco Prefers Gradual Approach to Rate Hikes

European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council member Ignazio Visco said on Tuesday that he would have preferred a more gradual approach to raising interest rates.

The ECB has raised interest rates by 375 basis points since December, and two more quarter-point moves are expected this month and next. Some officials have also suggested that another rate hike may be needed in September.

Visco said that the ECB's monetary policy stance is overall correct and necessary. However, he said that he would have preferred to see a slower pace of rate hikes.

"I would have preferred a more gradual approach," Visco said in an interview with Bloomberg. "But I understand that the Governing Council has decided to act more quickly."

Visco said that he believes that core inflation will slow, but it may take some time.

"Core inflation will eventually slow," Visco said. "But it will take some time for it to come down to levels that are consistent with our price stability target."

Visco's comments come as the ECB faces a delicate balancing act. The central bank needs to raise interest rates to combat inflation, but it also needs to avoid raising rates too quickly and causing a recession.

It remains to be seen how the ECB will balance these two objectives in the months ahead.
