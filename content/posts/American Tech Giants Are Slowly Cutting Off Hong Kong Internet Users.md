In a move that could have a significant impact on Hong Kong's economy and innovation ecosystem, American tech giants are slowly cutting off internet users in the city.

Google and OpenAI have not rolled out AI chatbots to Hong Kong, putting it alongside mainland China and North Korea. The article cites several reasons for this, including concerns about censorship and data security.

Google has said that it is "committed to providing access to information and services to all users around the world," but that it has "some concerns about the legal and regulatory environment in Hong Kong." OpenAI has said that it is "still evaluating the situation in Hong Kong" and that it "will continue to monitor the situation closely."

The article notes that the Chinese government has been increasingly cracking down on dissent in Hong Kong, and that this has led to concerns about censorship and data security. The article also notes that Hong Kong's economy is heavily reliant on the tech industry, and that the tech giants' decision to cut off Hong Kong could have a negative impact on the city's economy and innovation ecosystem.

Overall, the article suggests that the American tech giants' decision to cut off Hong Kong internet users is a significant development that could have a number of negative consequences for the city.
