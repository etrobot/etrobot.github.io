According to the Wall Street Journal, Uber is now offering a solution for parents who need help driving kids around by allowing 13- to 17-year-olds parent-supervised accounts for rides and food delivery. This is the first time teenagers as young as 13 years old will be able to have Uber accounts. 

With parent-supervised accounts, parents and caregivers can set up family profiles that will link multiple Uber accounts. They can pay for rides and deliveries as well as view real-time location and order updates from a centralized location. The new feature builds on Uber's existing Family Profiles feature, which allows family members to share payment methods and easily request rides for one another. 

Previously, teenagers under 18 were not allowed to use Uber without an adult present. However, the company has now recognized the need for a solution to help parents who may not have the time or ability to drive their kids around, especially during the pandemic. 

The new feature has been met with mixed reactions. Some parents are excited about the convenience it offers, while others are concerned about safety and security. To address these concerns, Uber has implemented several safety features for teen accounts. For example, the app will display a banner reminding teens to buckle up before the ride starts, and drivers will receive a notification that the rider is a teen. Additionally, parents can set limits on spending and can receive notifications when their teen arrives at their destination. 

The new feature is not without competition, as other ride-sharing and food delivery services such as Lyft and DoorDash have also started offering similar options for teenage users. However, Uber's move into the teenage market is a significant one, as it expands the company's user base and provides a new revenue stream. 

Overall, Uber's new parent-supervised accounts feature offers a convenient solution for parents and teenagers alike, but safety and security should always be top of mind. Parents should take advantage of the safety features available and talk to their teens about responsible use of the app.
