China continues to buy gold, adding 9.6 tons in May to bring its total holdings to 1,953.6 tons. This is the seventh consecutive month that China has added to its gold reserves.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has been buying gold since 2015, and its holdings have more than doubled in that time. There are a number of reasons why China is buying gold. One reason is that gold is seen as a safe haven asset, and China is looking to diversify its reserves away from US dollars. Another reason is that China is looking to hedge against inflation. Gold is also seen as a way to protect China's economic interests.

The PBOC's gold purchases have helped to boost the price of gold, which is currently trading at around $1,800 per ounce. The increase in gold prices is good for China's economy, as it helps to boost the value of its reserves.
