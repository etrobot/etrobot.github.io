## Traders Position for Fed Pause

Traders are positioning for a Fed pause in the interest rate hike cycle, but are also starting to unwind their bets on rate cuts later this year. This shift in sentiment is likely due to the recent rise in inflation, which has raised concerns about the pace of monetary tightening.

The Fed is expected to announce its decision on interest rates on Wednesday, June 14. If the Fed does signal that it is planning to pause its rate hike cycle, it could lead to a sell-off in Treasuries and a rally in stocks.

Here are some additional details from the article:

* Following Tuesday's May CPI report, which showed that inflation rose to a 40-year high, traders were heavy sellers of upside options targeting Fed rate cuts by the end of this year and into early next year.
* This suggests that traders are becoming more bearish on the outlook for the economy and are expecting the Fed to pause its rate hike cycle sooner than previously thought.
* The JPMorgan positioning survey showed that a record number of clients are now betting that the Fed will pause its rate hike cycle in September.
* This shift in sentiment is likely to put downward pressure on Treasury yields in the near term.

The Fed's decision on interest rates on Wednesday will be closely watched by investors.
