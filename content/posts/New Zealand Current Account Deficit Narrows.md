New Zealand's annual current account deficit narrowed in the first quarter of 2023, from 9% of gross domestic product (GDP) to 8.5%. The narrowing of the deficit was due to a number of factors, including the return of tourists and international students following the pandemic, which boosted services exports. The goods deficit widened to NZ$13.6 billion in the first quarter, from NZ$12.5 billion in the previous quarter. The services deficit narrowed to NZ$7.4 billion in the first quarter, from NZ$9.6 billion in the previous quarter. The current account deficit was NZ$5.2 billion in the first quarter, down from NZ$10.1 billion in the previous quarter.

Overall, the narrowing of the current account deficit is a positive sign for the New Zealand economy. It suggests that the economy is recovering from the pandemic and that the government's fiscal and monetary policies are working. However, the goods deficit widened in the first quarter, which suggests that imports are still outpacing exports. This could put pressure on the exchange rate and inflation in the coming months.
