**Hungary's Economy Chief Floats Idea of Raising Inflation Target**

Hungary's Economy Minister, Marton Nagy, has suggested that the country's inflation target should be raised from 3% to 4%.

Nagy said that the current target is no longer realistic, given the current high inflation levels. He said that a new target of 4% would be more appropriate.

Nagy's comments come as Hungary is facing a surge in inflation, which is currently at a 15-year high. The government has taken a number of measures to try to curb inflation, including raising interest rates and introducing price controls.

However, it remains to be seen whether these measures will be enough to bring inflation under control.

Nagy's suggestion has been met with mixed reactions. Some economists have said that it is a necessary step, while others have said that it could lead to higher interest rates and slower economic growth.

Only time will tell whether Nagy's suggestion will be successful in bringing inflation under control.
