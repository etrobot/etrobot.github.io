## Former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King Criticizes Rishi Sunak's Promise to Cut Inflation in Half

Former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King has criticized UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's promise to cut inflation in half this year.

King said that the government has little control over prices and that Sunak's promise is "not wise."

King also said that the Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates further in an effort to curb inflation.

The article goes on to discuss the impact of inflation on the UK economy and the challenges that the government faces in trying to bring it under control.

## Impact of Inflation on the UK Economy

Inflation in the UK is currently at a 40-year high of 9%.

This means that the prices of goods and services are rising at their fastest rate in four decades.

Inflation is having a negative impact on the UK economy in a number of ways.

* It is reducing the purchasing power of households, which is leading to a decline in consumer spending.
* It is making it more expensive for businesses to operate, which is leading to job losses and a slowdown in economic growth.
* It is increasing the government's borrowing costs, which is putting pressure on the public finances.

## Challenges Facing the Government in Tackling Inflation

The government faces a number of challenges in trying to bring inflation under control.

* The war in Ukraine is pushing up energy prices, which is a major driver of inflation.
* The UK is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has weakened the economy and made it more difficult to raise interest rates.
* The government is facing pressure from voters to do more to help people with the cost of living, which could make it difficult to take tough measures to curb inflation.

## Conclusion

It remains to be seen whether the government will be able to bring inflation under control.

However, King's comments suggest that it will be a difficult task.
