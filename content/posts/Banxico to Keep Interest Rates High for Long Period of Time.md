## Banxico to Keep Interest Rates High for Long Period of Time

Mexico's central bank, Banxico, has signaled that it will keep interest rates high for a long period of time in order to tame inflation.

The bank's decision comes as inflation in Mexico has reached a 20-year high. In May 2023, inflation was 7.65%, well above Banxico's target of 3%.

Banxico has raised interest rates by 75 basis points since December, and it is widely expected to raise rates again in the coming months.

The bank's decision is likely to weigh on economic growth, but it is seen as necessary to bring inflation under control.

In a statement, Banxico said that it is "committed to bringing inflation back to its target of 3%." The bank said that it will continue to raise rates until inflation is "well-anchored" at the target level.

The bank's decision comes as the Mexican economy is facing a number of headwinds, including rising inflation, a slowdown in global economic growth, and the war in Ukraine.

Despite these challenges, the bank is confident that the Mexican economy will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years.

### Impact on the Mexican economy

The decision by Banxico to keep interest rates high for a long period of time is likely to have a number of impacts on the Mexican economy.

* **Higher interest rates will make it more expensive for businesses to borrow money, which could lead to slower investment and economic growth.**
* **Higher interest rates will also make it more expensive for consumers to borrow money, which could lead to slower spending and economic growth.**
* **Higher interest rates could also lead to a slowdown in the Mexican peso, which could make imported goods more expensive and could further increase inflation.**

However, the decision by Banxico to keep interest rates high could also have some positive impacts on the Mexican economy.

* **Higher interest rates could help to reduce inflation, which would make it easier for businesses and consumers to plan for the future.**
* **Higher interest rates could also help to attract foreign investment, which could boost the Mexican economy.**

Overall, the decision by Banxico to keep interest rates high for a long period of time is a complex one with both positive and negative impacts on the Mexican economy. The full impact of the decision will not be known for some time.
