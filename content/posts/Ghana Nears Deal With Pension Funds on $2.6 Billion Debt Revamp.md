Ghana's pension funds are close to agreeing to a deal to restructure $2.6 billion worth of government bonds they hold. The deal would see the government extend the maturity dates of the bonds and reduce the interest rates on them. The restructuring is part of Ghana's efforts to reduce its debt burden and improve its fiscal position. The deal is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks.

The article also mentions that the restructuring could have a negative impact on the pension funds' returns. However, the funds are reportedly willing to accept the deal in order to help Ghana's economy.

**Here are some of the key points of the deal:**

* The government will extend the maturity dates of the bonds by an average of 10 years.
* The interest rates on the bonds will be reduced by an average of 2 percentage points.
* The deal is expected to save the government $1 billion in interest payments over the next 10 years.

**The deal is a positive development for Ghana's economy.** It will help the government reduce its debt burden and improve its fiscal position. This will make it easier for the government to borrow money in the future and invest in infrastructure and other projects that will boost economic growth.

The deal is also a positive development for Ghana's pension funds. While the restructuring could have a negative impact on their returns in the short term, it is important to remember that the long-term health of the economy is more important than the short-term returns of any one group of investors.

Overall, the deal is a positive development for both Ghana and its pension funds. It is a win-win situation that will help to improve the country's economy and the financial security of its citizens.
