New York City is losing its grip on the talent race. College graduates and more affluent residents are fleeing the high cost of living in the Big Apple, and they're not just moving to other major cities. A new trend is emerging: people are choosing to move to mid-sized and smaller cities.

There are a few reasons for this trend. First, the cost of living in smaller cities is much lower than in major cities. This means that people can afford to buy a home, save for retirement, and have a higher quality of life. Second, smaller cities are often more affordable than major cities. This means that people can afford to live in a nicer neighborhood, have access to better schools, and have more disposable income.

Small towns are also finding it easier to develop the services and amenities to attract new talent than it is for large cities to build affordable housing. This is because small towns are often more nimble and can respond to change more quickly. They can also offer a more personal touch, which can be appealing to young professionals who are looking for a sense of community.

The trend of people moving to smaller cities is good news for those who have been priced out of major cities. It also means that small towns are becoming more vibrant and attractive places to live. If you're looking for a place to live that offers a high quality of life at an affordable price, then you should consider moving to a smaller city.
