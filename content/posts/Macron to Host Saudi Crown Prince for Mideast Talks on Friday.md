**Macron to Host Saudi Crown Prince for Mideast Talks**

French President Emmanuel Macron will host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for talks in Paris on Friday. The meeting comes amid rising tensions in the Middle East, following the Houthi-led missile attack on Abu Dhabi.

Macron is expected to discuss the war in Yemen, the Iranian nuclear deal, and energy security with the Saudi crown prince. The meeting is also seen as an opportunity for Macron to repair ties with Saudi Arabia, which have been strained in recent years.

**The Houthi-led missile attack on Abu Dhabi**

The Houthi-led missile attack on Abu Dhabi on January 17 was the first time the group had successfully targeted the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since the start of the war in Yemen in 2015. The attack killed three people and injured six others.

The UAE is part of a Saudi-led coalition that has been fighting the Houthis in Yemen since 2015. The war in Yemen has caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.

**The Saudi crown prince's human rights record**

The Saudi crown prince has been accused of human rights abuses, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Macron has been critical of the Saudi crown prince's human rights record. However, Macron has also said that he believes it is important to maintain dialogue with Saudi Arabia.

**The meeting between Macron and the Saudi crown prince**

The meeting between Macron and the Saudi crown prince is a sign that France is still willing to engage with Saudi Arabia, despite the tensions between the two countries. The meeting is also likely to focus on the war in Yemen, the Iranian nuclear deal, and energy security.

**Conclusion**

The meeting between Macron and the Saudi crown prince is a significant event. It will be interesting to see what comes out of the meeting and how it impacts the relationship between France and Saudi Arabia.
