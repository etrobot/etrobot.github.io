## Don't Leave Curbing Inflation to the ECB: Opinion

The European Central Bank (ECB) is facing a difficult task in trying to curb inflation without causing a recession. The ECB has already raised interest rates, but it is not clear if this will be enough to bring inflation under control. The ECB may need to take more aggressive action, such as quantitative tightening, but this could lead to a recession. Governments in the eurozone also need to take action to help the ECB curb inflation. Governments can do this by reducing their budget deficits and by reforming their economies to make them more competitive.

**What is the ECB's mandate?**

The ECB has a mandate to keep inflation below but close to 2%.

**What is the current inflation rate in the eurozone?**

Inflation in the eurozone has been rising rapidly in recent months, reaching a record high of 8.1% in May.

**What has the ECB done to curb inflation?**

The ECB has raised interest rates twice in recent months. However, it is not clear if this will be enough to bring inflation under control.

**What could the ECB do to curb inflation?**

The ECB could take more aggressive action, such as quantitative tightening. However, this could lead to a recession.

**What can governments in the eurozone do to help the ECB curb inflation?**

Governments in the eurozone can reduce their budget deficits and reform their economies to make them more competitive. This would help to reduce demand for goods and services, which would help to bring inflation down.

**What is the risk of not curbing inflation?**

If inflation is not curbed, it could spiral out of control and lead to a recession. This would have a devastating impact on the eurozone economy.

**Conclusion**

The ECB and governments in the eurozone need to work together to curb inflation. The ECB needs to take more aggressive action, but governments also need to do their part to reduce budget deficits and reform their economies. If the ECB and governments do not work together, inflation could spiral out of control and lead to a recession.
