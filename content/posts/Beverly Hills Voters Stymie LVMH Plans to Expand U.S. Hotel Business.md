Beverly Hills voters have rejected plans by LVMH's Cheval Blanc brand to build its first hotel in the U.S. The proposed hotel would have been located on Rodeo Drive and would have had 109 rooms. The vote was 53% to 47% against the project.

Some residents had concerns about the impact the hotel would have on traffic and parking. Others were concerned about the height of the building. LVMH has not said if it will appeal the decision.

The vote is a setback for LVMH, which has been expanding its hotel business in recent years. The company has opened hotels in Paris, London, and Tokyo. It also has plans to open hotels in New York City and Miami.

The vote in Beverly Hills is a reminder that even luxury brands can face challenges when they try to expand into new markets.
