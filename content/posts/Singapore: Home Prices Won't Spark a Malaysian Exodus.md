**Singapore: Home Prices Won't Spark a Malaysian Exodus**

The recent surge in home prices in Singapore has led to concerns that it could spark an exodus of Malaysians to Singapore. However, experts argue that this is unlikely to happen.

There are a number of reasons why Malaysians are still likely to choose to live in Malaysia, even with the higher home prices in Singapore. First, the cost of living in Malaysia is still lower than in Singapore. Second, Malaysians have strong ties to their families and friends in Malaysia, and they are reluctant to leave them behind. Third, there are cultural similarities between Malaysia and Singapore, which makes it easier for Malaysians to adjust to life in Malaysia.

Of course, the surge in home prices in Singapore will make it more difficult for some Malaysians to afford to live in Singapore. However, for the most part, Malaysians are still likely to choose to live in Malaysia, even with the higher home prices.
