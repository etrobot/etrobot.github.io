**RBA to Raise Cash Rate to 4.6%?**

A group of Australian economists are predicting that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will raise the cash rate to 4.6% by the end of 2023. This would be the highest level for the cash rate since 1994.

The economists are predicting such a sharp rise in interest rates because they believe that inflation is out of control. Inflation in Australia is currently running at 5.1%, which is well above the RBA's target of 2-3%.

The economists believe that the RBA will need to raise interest rates aggressively in order to bring inflation under control. A rate rise to 4.6% would have a significant impact on the Australian economy. It would make it more expensive for businesses to borrow money, which could lead to slower economic growth. It would also make it more expensive for households to borrow money, which could lead to a decline in housing prices.

The article also quotes a number of economists who are not as hawkish as the group mentioned above. These economists believe that the RBA will not need to raise interest rates as high as 4.6%. They believe that the RBA will be able to bring inflation under control with a series of smaller interest rate rises.

Only time will tell which group of economists is correct. However, it is clear that the RBA is facing a difficult challenge in trying to bring inflation under control.
