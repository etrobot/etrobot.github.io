## China Supports South Africa in Hosting BRICS Activities

China has expressed its support for South Africa in hosting various BRICS activities this year. The announcement was made by Chinese President Xi Jinping during a phone call with his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday.

South Africa is the current chair of BRICS, a bloc of five emerging economies that also includes Brazil, Russia, India, and China. The bloc is expected to hold a number of high-level meetings in South Africa this year, including a summit of BRICS leaders.

Xi's support for South Africa is seen as a sign of China's commitment to the BRICS bloc and its relationship with South Africa.

The BRICS bloc is a relatively new economic and political association that was formed in 2009. The bloc has been growing in importance in recent years, and it is seen by some as a potential counterweight to the G7, a group of seven industrialized nations.

South Africa's chairmanship of BRICS this year is seen as an opportunity for the country to raise its profile on the global stage. The country is also hoping to use the chairmanship to promote its own interests, such as its economic development and its role as a regional leader.

The BRICS summit is expected to be held in South Africa in July. The summit will be the first time that the BRICS leaders have met in person since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The summit is expected to be dominated by discussions about the global economy and the war in Ukraine.
