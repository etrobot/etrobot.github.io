## Five Key Charts to Watch in Global Commodity Markets This Week

Oil, wheat, copper, gold, and natural gas are all expected to be volatile this week, as traders await the release of key economic data and monitor the ongoing geopolitical situation.

* **Oil prices** are expected to remain volatile this week, with traders awaiting the release of key US inventory data. The American Petroleum Institute (API) will release its weekly inventory report on Tuesday, followed by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday.
* **Wheat prices** are also expected to be volatile this week, as traders monitor the situation in Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine are two of the world's largest exporters of wheat, and the ongoing conflict has disrupted global supply chains.
* **The price of copper** is expected to remain under pressure this week, as concerns about a global economic slowdown weigh on demand. Copper is a key industrial metal, and its price is often seen as a barometer of global economic activity.
* **The price of gold** is expected to remain supported this week, as investors seek out safe haven assets amid the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty. Gold is seen as a hedge against inflation and economic turmoil, and its price has been rising in recent months.
* **The price of natural gas** is expected to remain volatile this week, as traders monitor the weather in the United States. The US is the world's largest consumer of natural gas, and cold weather can lead to increased demand for the fuel.

In addition to these five key charts, traders will also be watching the following data releases this week:

* **US retail sales data on Wednesday**
* **US housing starts data on Wednesday**
* **US jobless claims data on Thursday**
* **US industrial production data on Friday**

These data releases could provide further clues about the direction of the global economy and commodity markets.
