Haruhiko Kuroda's reappointment as Bank of Japan Governor has been welcomed by yen carry traders, who believe that his dovish stance will continue to support the Japanese currency.

Kuroda has pledged to keep interest rates low and continue with the BOJ's quantitative easing program, which has helped to weaken the yen and make it a more attractive funding currency for carry trades.

Carry traders borrow in low-yielding currencies, such as the yen, and invest in higher-yielding currencies, such as the Australian dollar or New Zealand dollar. The interest rate differential between the two currencies provides the trader with a profit, as long as the exchange rate between the two currencies does not move too much.

The yen has been weakening against the US dollar since Kuroda took office in 2013, and it is currently trading at its lowest level in over 20 years. The weakening yen has been a boon for Japanese exporters, who have seen their profits rise as a result of the cheaper currency.

However, the weak yen has also been a source of concern for Japanese policymakers, who worry that it could lead to inflation and asset bubbles.

Overall, the reappointment of Haruhiko Kuroda as Bank of Japan Governor is a positive development for yen carry traders. Kuroda's dovish stance is likely to continue to support the Japanese currency, which will make it a more attractive funding currency for carry trades.
