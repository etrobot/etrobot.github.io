### Fed's Goolsbee Likens Rate Pause to 'Reconnaissance' on Policy

The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said the central bank's decision to pause interest rate hikes is a “reconnaissance mission” to assess the impact of its previous rate increases.

Goolsbee said the Fed is still committed to its goal of bringing inflation down to 2%, but it needs to be “nimble” in responding to the evolving economic data.

He said the Fed is watching closely for signs that inflation is starting to come down, and it could resume raising rates if that happens.

However, Goolsbee said the Fed is also mindful of the risks to the economy, such as the war in Ukraine and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Overall, Goolsbee said the Fed is in a “wait-and-see” mode, and it will adjust its policy stance as needed to achieve its goals.

Here are some of the key takeaways from Goolsbee's comments:

* The Fed is still committed to bringing inflation down to 2%, but it is willing to be flexible in its approach.
* The Fed is watching closely for signs that inflation is starting to come down.
* The Fed is mindful of the risks to the economy, such as the war in Ukraine and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
* The Fed is in a “wait-and-see” mode and will adjust its policy stance as needed.

It remains to be seen how the Fed's decision to pause interest rate hikes will impact the economy. However, Goolsbee's comments suggest that the Fed is committed to its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, and it will be flexible in its approach to achieving these goals.
