**Modi's Economic Push Hits a Major Setback**

The Indian government's $24 billion plan to boost manufacturing in the country has hit a major setback, with Vedanta Resources Ltd.'s $10 billion chip unit being delayed.

The delay is a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to make India a global manufacturing hub and comes at a time when the country's economy is facing headwinds from rising inflation and a slowdown in growth.

The Vedanta chip unit was one of the flagship projects of Modi's Make in India initiative, which aims to attract foreign investment and create jobs in the manufacturing sector.

The delay in the Vedanta chip unit is likely to dampen investor sentiment and make it more difficult for Modi to attract foreign investment in other manufacturing projects.

The article also notes that the Vedanta chip unit delay is just one of a number of challenges facing Modi's economic agenda. The country is also facing rising inflation, a slowdown in growth, and a shortage of skilled workers.

Despite these challenges, Modi has vowed to continue his economic reforms. He has said that he is committed to making India a "global economic powerhouse" and that he will not be deterred by the setbacks.

It remains to be seen whether Modi will be able to achieve his economic goals. However, the Vedanta chip unit delay is a sign that the road ahead will be difficult.
