**Winds of Change Blow Through Turkey's Economy**

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has appointed a new finance minister and central bank governor, signaling a shift in economic policy. The new finance minister, Mehmet Simsek, is a former investment banker who has pledged to restore confidence in the Turkish economy. The new central bank governor, Hafize Gaye Erkan, is a former banker who has promised to raise interest rates to combat inflation.

The changes in economic policy come at a time when Turkey is facing a number of economic challenges, including high inflation, a weak currency, and a current account deficit. The success of the new economic team will depend on its ability to address these challenges and restore confidence in the Turkish economy.

**Erdogan's Economic Policies**

Erdogan has been criticized for his unorthodox economic policies, which have included keeping interest rates low in an effort to boost economic growth. These policies have led to high inflation, which has eroded the value of the Turkish lira and made it difficult for businesses to operate. The current account deficit has also widened, as Turkey has imported more goods and services than it has exported.

**The New Economic Team**

The new economic team will need to take a more orthodox approach to economic policy if it is to address these challenges. This will likely involve raising interest rates, which will help to slow inflation and stabilize the currency. The new team will also need to implement reforms to improve the country's business environment and attract foreign investment.

**The Future of Turkey's Economy**

The success of the new economic team will be critical to the future of Turkey's economy. If they are successful, they could help to restore confidence in the Turkish economy and lay the foundation for sustainable growth. However, if they are unsuccessful, the country could face a number of economic challenges in the years to come.
