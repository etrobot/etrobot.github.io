Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida unveiled a policy wish list on Wednesday, calling for increased investment in infrastructure and research and development, as well as increased defense spending.

Kishida also reaffirmed Japan's commitment to the US-Japan alliance and to working with other countries to address global challenges such as climate change and nuclear proliferation.

In addition, Kishida announced plans to increase the minimum wage and to provide more support for the elderly.

The policy wish list is seen as a key part of Kishida's efforts to boost his popularity and to position himself as a strong leader ahead of the next general election, which is due to be held by 2025.
