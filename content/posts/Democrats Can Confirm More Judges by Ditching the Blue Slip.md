## Democrats Can Confirm More Judges by Ditching the Blue Slip

The blue slip is a Senate tradition that allows home-state senators to block judicial nominees. Democrats have been unable to confirm many of their judicial nominees because of the blue slip. Democrats can confirm more judges by getting rid of the blue slip.

The blue slip tradition dates back to the 19th century. Under this tradition, home-state senators are allowed to review and comment on judicial nominees from their state. If a home-state senator objects to a nominee, the nominee is unlikely to be confirmed.

Democrats have been unable to confirm many of their judicial nominees because of the blue slip. This is because Republicans have controlled the Senate for most of the past decade. Republicans have used the blue slip to block many of President Obama's judicial nominees.

Democrats can confirm more judges by getting rid of the blue slip. This would allow the Senate to confirm nominees based on their qualifications, not on the political affiliation of their home-state senators.

Getting rid of the blue slip would be a controversial move. Some people argue that the blue slip is an important tradition that protects the rights of home-state senators. Others argue that the blue slip is an outdated tradition that gives too much power to home-state senators.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to get rid of the blue slip is up to the Senate. If Democrats want to confirm more judges, they will need to get rid of the blue slip.

**What do you think? Should the Senate get rid of the blue slip?**
