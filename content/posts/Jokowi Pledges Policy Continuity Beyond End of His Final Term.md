**Jokowi Pledges to Continue Policies Beyond 2024**

Indonesian President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) has pledged to continue his policies beyond the end of his final term in 2024. Jokowi made the pledge during a speech in Jakarta on Wednesday. Jokowi said that he wants to ensure that his policies, such as infrastructure development and poverty alleviation, continue even after he steps down.

Jokowi's pledge comes amid concerns about political instability in Indonesia. The country is due to hold presidential elections in 2024, and there is no clear frontrunner in the race. Jokowi's pledge could help to ease some of the concerns about political instability in Indonesia.

Jokowi's policies have been praised by some for helping to reduce poverty and improve infrastructure in Indonesia. However, his policies have also been criticized by others for being too focused on economic growth and not enough on social welfare.

It remains to be seen whether Jokowi's pledge to continue his policies beyond 2024 will be fulfilled. However, his pledge is a positive sign for Indonesia's future.
