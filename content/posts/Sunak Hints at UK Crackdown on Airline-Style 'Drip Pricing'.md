## UK Government Considers Crackdown on Drip Pricing

The UK government is considering cracking down on a controversial pricing practice known as "drip pricing." Drip pricing is when businesses advertise a low price for a product or service, but then add on extra fees for things like delivery or insurance.

The government's interest in cracking down on drip pricing comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunak expressed concern about the practice. Sunak said that he is "looking at what more we can do" to protect consumers from drip pricing.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is already investigating drip pricing and is expected to publish its findings later this year. If the CMA finds that drip pricing is unfair, it could recommend that the government take action to ban it.

Drip pricing is a controversial practice that has been criticized by consumer groups. Critics argue that it is misleading and unfair to advertise a low price for a product or service, only to add on extra fees that can significantly increase the cost.

The government's consideration of cracking down on drip pricing is a positive step for consumer protection. If the government takes action to ban drip pricing, it would send a strong message to businesses that they cannot mislead consumers with deceptive pricing practices.
