## Climate Change Policy: Where's the Justice in Net Zero?

The concept of "net zero" emissions is gaining traction as a way to address climate change. However, there are concerns that net zero could exacerbate existing inequalities, particularly between rich and poor countries.

**What is net zero?**

Net zero emissions means that a country or organization produces no more greenhouse gases than it removes from the atmosphere. Net zero is often seen as a necessary step to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, which include more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and mass extinctions.

**Concerns about net zero**

There are concerns that net zero could exacerbate existing inequalities. For example, rich countries have historically contributed more to climate change than poor countries, and they have benefited more from the use of fossil fuels. As a result, rich countries have a responsibility to help poor countries transition to a low-carbon economy. Otherwise, net zero could lead to a "race to the bottom" in terms of environmental standards, as countries compete to attract investment in low-carbon technologies. This could lead to a situation where developing countries are forced to sacrifice environmental protection in order to attract investment. Additionally, there is a risk that net zero could displace emissions from developed countries to developing countries, where environmental regulations are weaker. This could lead to a situation where the most vulnerable people are disproportionately affected by climate change.

**How to ensure net zero is fair and just**

It is important to ensure that net zero is implemented in a way that is fair and just, and that does not harm the most vulnerable people. Here are some ways to do this:

* Developed countries need to provide financial and technical assistance to developing countries to help them transition to a low-carbon economy.
* Developed countries need to ensure that their own emissions reductions are ambitious enough to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
* Developed countries need to work with developing countries to ensure that net zero does not displace emissions from one country to another.
* Developed countries need to ensure that net zero does not lead to a "race to the bottom" in terms of environmental standards.

By taking these steps, we can ensure that net zero is a force for good and not a source of further inequality.
