In recent weeks, the U.S. debt ceiling debate has been heating up, with Speaker Kevin McCarthy finding himself in a difficult position. The New York Times reports that McCarthy is facing a dilemma as he tries to navigate the competing interests of his Republican caucus and the Biden administration[^1].

The Washington Post explains that the power to raise the debt ceiling lies with Congress, and not the President. Despite speculation that President Biden could use the Fourteenth Amendment to raise the debt ceiling, the U.S. Constitution is clear that the President doesn't have the power of the purse[^2]. 

Last week, McCarthy managed to narrowly pass a bill to raise the U.S. debt ceiling, but this move has set up high-stakes negotiations with the Biden administration. According to MSNBC, McCarthy's plan is now "completely unraveling" as he faces criticism from both Democrats and Republicans[^5]. 

New York Magazine accuses McCarthy of lying about his main argument for raising the debt ceiling, calling the argument a "lie" and "nonsense."[^6] Meanwhile, ABC News offers an explanation of all the potential options if the Biden administration and McCarthy fail to reach a deal[^4].

Overall, the U.S. debt ceiling debate is a complex and contentious issue that is likely to continue to dominate headlines in the coming weeks. As McCarthy works to navigate this issue, he will need to carefully balance the interests of his caucus with the demands of the Biden administration.
