## US Inflation May Be Moderating, but China's Is Even Slower

US inflation is likely to slow down in a key report due on Tuesday, but it is still expected to be too high for the Federal Reserve. China's inflation is even slower than the US, at 0.2% year-on-year.

The difference in inflation between the two countries is due to different economic policies. The US government focused on pumping out stimulus checks and massive monetary easing during the pandemic, while China focused on the supply side, encouraging companies to keep production going.

As a result of these different policies, the US has experienced too-strong demand hitting too-little supply, which has led to higher inflation. China, on the other hand, has experienced too-little demand hitting too-much supply, which has led to lower inflation.

The article concludes by saying that the different inflation rates in the US and China are a sign of the different economic challenges that the two countries are facing. The US is trying to cool down its economy, while China is trying to stimulate its economy. It remains to be seen how successful these different policies will be.
