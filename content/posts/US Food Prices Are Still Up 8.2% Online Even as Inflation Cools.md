## Food Prices Still Rising

Food prices online are still up 8.2% in May 2023, even as overall inflation has cooled. This is due to a number of factors, including higher transportation costs, rising labor costs, and supply chain disruptions.

The rising cost of food is putting a strain on household budgets, particularly for low-income families. The Biden administration has taken some steps to address the issue, but it remains to be seen whether these measures will be enough to bring down food prices.

Here are some additional details from the article:

* The Consumer Price Index for food rose 8.2% in May from a year ago, the largest 12-month increase since May 2008.
* The increase was driven by higher prices for all major food categories, including meat, poultry, fish, fruits, and vegetables.
* Transportation costs, which account for about 15% of the cost of food, rose 10.6% in May from a year ago.
* Labor costs, which account for about 30% of the cost of food, rose 6.2% in May from a year ago.
* Supply chain disruptions, which have been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have also contributed to higher food prices.
* The Biden administration has taken some steps to address the issue of rising food prices, including releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower transportation costs and providing financial assistance to farmers.
* However, it remains to be seen whether these measures will be enough to bring down food prices significantly.
