## LGIM Abandons Mark-to-Market Pricing

LGIM, a large UK investment manager, has abandoned mark-to-market pricing for its bond funds. Mark-to-market pricing is a method of valuing assets based on their current market prices. LGIM's decision to abandon mark-to-market pricing was controversial, with some arguing that it would lead to a loss of transparency and accountability. However, LGIM defended its decision, arguing that it was necessary to protect the interests of its investors.

The decision by LGIM is likely to have a wider impact on the UK investment industry, as other managers may be forced to make similar decisions in the future.

### What is mark-to-market pricing?

Mark-to-market pricing is a method of valuing assets based on their current market prices. This means that the value of an asset is constantly changing, based on the latest market conditions.

### Why did LGIM abandon mark-to-market pricing?

LGIM said that it abandoned mark-to-market pricing because it was not a reliable measure of the value of bonds in the current market conditions. The market for bonds is illiquid, meaning that there are few buyers and sellers, and prices are being driven by speculative trading.

LGIM said that it would instead use a valuation method that was based on the cash flows of the bonds. This method is known as "amortized cost" pricing. Amortized cost pricing is a more conservative method of valuation, and it is less likely to be affected by short-term fluctuations in the market.

### What impact will this have on the UK investment industry?

The decision by LGIM is likely to have a wider impact on the UK investment industry. Other managers may be forced to make similar decisions in the future, as the market for bonds remains illiquid and volatile. This could lead to a loss of transparency and accountability in the investment industry. However, it could also lead to a more stable and equitable market for investors.
