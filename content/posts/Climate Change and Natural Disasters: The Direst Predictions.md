Natural disasters seem to be on the rise, and many are wondering if climate change is the main cause. While it's not the only factor, climate change is certainly exacerbating the problem. In this blog post, we'll explore how climate change is making natural disasters worse than our direst predictions.

The article titled "Why Natural Disasters Seem Worse Than Our Direst Predictions" [^1^][4] discusses how global warming of 1.09C (where we are now), 1.5C (the level climate diplomats are targeting, likely to soon be out of reach), and 2.8C to 3.2C (where we’re currently headed) can’t help but make things worse. Climate change is causing more extreme weather, like heat waves, droughts, and floods [^2^]. These extreme weather events can lead to wildfires, mudslides, and other natural disasters [^1^][4].

It's important to note that while climate change is making natural disasters worse, they are becoming less deadly. According to a report by the United Nations, while the number of weather-related disasters is increasing, the number of deaths from these disasters is decreasing [^3^]. This is due to better disaster preparedness and response efforts.

However, the increase in natural disasters is taking a toll on people's mental health. Climate change-induced disasters can cause anxiety, depression, and eco-grief [^6^]. It's important to address the mental health impacts of natural disasters as well as the physical impacts.

In conclusion, climate change is making natural disasters worse than our direst predictions. While we are becoming better prepared for these disasters, we need to address the root cause of the problem and work towards mitigating the effects of climate change.
