According to multiple news sources such as Bollyinside [1], Yahoo News [2][3], MSN [4], and Quartz [5], a former Apple engineer named Weibao Wang has been charged with attempting to steal the company's technology related to autonomous systems, including self-driving cars. 

Wang was accused of stealing thousands of files containing proprietary information while secretly working for an unnamed Chinese company. The stolen files included engineering schematics, technical manuals, and diagrams related to Apple's autonomous vehicle project. The information was discovered on his personal computer after he submitted his resignation to Apple in 2018.

The US Department of Justice filed charges against Wang in Santa Clara, California, in July 2020. He was indicted on one count of trade secret theft and one count of attempted theft of trade secrets. The maximum penalty for each count is 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Wang had worked for Apple since 2015 as a hardware engineer on the company's secretive self-driving car project. According to the indictment, Wang downloaded the files to his own laptop while he was still employed at Apple and then resigned a day before buying a one-way ticket to China.

The case highlights the ongoing challenge that companies face in protecting their intellectual property, particularly when it comes to autonomous systems and self-driving cars. The technology is highly valuable and sought after, and companies are investing significant resources to develop it.

Apple has been notoriously secretive about its autonomous vehicle project, known as Project Titan, which has been in development for years. The company has never publicly acknowledged the project, although rumors and reports suggest that it has been working on self-driving car technology since at least 2014.

In response to the charges against Wang, Apple stated that it takes "the protection of our intellectual property and the privacy of our customers' personal information very seriously." The company added that it has "comprehensive security protocols in place to protect our intellectual property and employees."

The case is still ongoing, and Wang has yet to stand trial. If found guilty, he could face significant prison time and fines. The outcome of the case could have significant implications for the future of autonomous systems and self-driving cars.
