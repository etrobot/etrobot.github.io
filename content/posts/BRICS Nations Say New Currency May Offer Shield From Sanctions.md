**BRICS Nations Explore New Currency to Shield from Sanctions**

The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) have agreed to explore the creation of a new reserve currency that could offer a shield from sanctions. The move is seen as a response to the Western sanctions imposed on Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine.

The new currency would be based on a basket of currencies from the BRICS nations and would be used for trade and investment between the countries. The creation of a new reserve currency would be a major challenge, but it could have far-reaching implications for the global financial system.

The article also notes that the BRICS nations have been working to reduce their reliance on the US dollar for trade and investment. This is in part due to concerns about the dollar's dominance and the risk of sanctions.

The creation of a new reserve currency would be a major step towards reducing the BRICS nations' reliance on the US dollar. It would also be a significant challenge to the US-led global financial system.

It remains to be seen whether the BRICS nations will be able to successfully create a new reserve currency. However, the move is a sign that the countries are increasingly looking to reduce their reliance on the US dollar and the Western financial system.
