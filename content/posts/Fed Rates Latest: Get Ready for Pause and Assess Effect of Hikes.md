**Fed to Hike Rates by 0.75%, Pause After July**

The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by 0.75% at its meeting on Wednesday, July 13. This would be the largest rate hike since 1994. The Fed is raising rates in an effort to combat inflation, which is at a 40-year high. However, there are concerns that the Fed's aggressive rate hikes could lead to a recession. The Fed is expected to pause its rate hikes after July and assess the impact of the hikes so far.

The Fed's decision to raise rates is a significant change in policy. The Fed has been very accommodative in recent years, keeping interest rates low and buying assets in an effort to stimulate the economy. However, the Fed is now in a different environment. Inflation is high and the economy is growing at a rapid pace. The Fed is therefore taking steps to tighten monetary policy in an effort to bring inflation under control.

It remains to be seen how the Fed's actions will affect the economy. There is a risk that the Fed's aggressive rate hikes could lead to a recession. However, the Fed is hoping that it can engineer a soft landing, which is a period of economic growth that is accompanied by falling inflation.
