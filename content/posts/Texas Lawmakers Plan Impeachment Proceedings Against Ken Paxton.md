**Texas Lawmakers Plan Impeachment Proceedings Against Ken Paxton**

Texas lawmakers are planning to begin impeachment proceedings against Attorney General Ken Paxton. The articles of impeachment drafted against Paxton include conspiracy, dereliction of duty, misapplication of public resources, and unfitness for office.

Paxton is accused of using his office to help a wealthy donor and of failing to properly investigate securities fraud allegations against the donor. He is also accused of using his office to enrich himself and of lying to the FBI.

Paxton has denied all of the allegations against him. He has said that the impeachment proceedings are politically motivated and that he is the victim of a witch hunt.

The impeachment proceedings are likely to be a lengthy and contentious process. It is unclear whether Paxton will be removed from office, but the proceedings will likely damage his reputation and make it difficult for him to continue serving as attorney general.

**Here are some additional details from the article:**

* Paxton is a Republican who has been attorney general of Texas since 2015. He is the first sitting attorney general in Texas to be impeached.
* The allegations against Paxton were first made public in 2015. The FBI began investigating the allegations in 2017.
* Paxton has been indicted on two felony charges of securities fraud. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
* The impeachment proceedings are being led by a House committee of seven Democrats and two Republicans. The committee is expected to vote on whether to recommend that the full House impeach Paxton in the coming weeks.
* If the full House votes to impeach Paxton, the Senate would then hold a trial to determine whether to remove him from office. A two-thirds majority vote in the Senate is required to convict and remove Paxton from office.

The impeachment of Ken Paxton is a significant event in Texas politics. It is the first time in over a century that a sitting attorney general in Texas has been impeached. The outcome of the impeachment proceedings will have a major impact on the future of Texas politics.
