Asian stocks fell on Wednesday after data showed that China's manufacturing activity slowed in June. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.4 in June from 51.1 in May. A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while a reading above 50 indicates expansion.

The slowdown in China's manufacturing sector is a sign that the world's second-largest economy is slowing. China is a major driver of global growth, so the slowdown in its manufacturing sector is likely to have a negative impact on global growth.

Other Asian markets also fell on Wednesday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index down 1.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index down 0.9%. US stocks are also expected to open lower on Wednesday.

The slowdown in China's manufacturing sector is a reminder that the global economy is still facing headwinds. The US-China trade war, Brexit, and rising interest rates are all weighing on global growth.

It remains to be seen how long the slowdown in China's manufacturing sector will last. However, the slowdown is a sign that the global economy is not out of the woods yet.
