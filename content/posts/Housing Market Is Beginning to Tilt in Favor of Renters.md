The housing market is beginning to tilt in favor of renters, as rising home prices and mortgage rates make it more expensive to buy a home.

The trend is being driven by a number of factors, including:

* The COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a decline in the supply of homes for sale.
* The war in Ukraine, which has caused disruptions to the global economy and led to higher prices for goods and services, including housing.
* Rising inflation, which has made it more expensive to borrow money to buy a home.

As a result of these factors, more and more people are choosing to rent instead of buy. This is putting upward pressure on rents, which are expected to continue to rise in the coming months and years.

The trend of rising rents is likely to have a number of consequences, including:

* Making it more difficult for people to afford housing.
* Increasing the number of people who are homeless.
* Putting a strain on the budgets of low- and middle-income families.

The housing market is a complex system, and it is difficult to predict how the trend of rising rents will play out in the long term. However, it is clear that the trend is having a significant impact on the housing market and on the lives of many people.
