The conflict in Ukraine has been ongoing for years, with no clear end in sight. As technology advances, it has become increasingly intertwined with the conflict, with both sides utilizing it to gain an advantage. 

On May 17, 2023, Bloomberg published an article titled "In Ukraine, Technology Only Thickens the Fog of War" by Leonid Bershidsky. The article highlights the role of technology in the conflict, and how it has made it harder to discern what is happening on the ground. 

While technology has made it easier to gather information about the conflict, it has also made it easier for both sides to spread propaganda and misinformation. Drones, phones, and satellite technology have all been used to gather information about the conflict, but they have also been used to spread false information. 

For example, both sides have used social media to spread propaganda and misinformation. This has made it difficult for people to know what is really happening in the conflict. Additionally, both sides have used technology to target each other's communication systems and disrupt their ability to communicate effectively. 

The article also highlights the role of technology companies in the conflict. Companies like Google and Facebook have been criticized for their role in spreading misinformation and failing to adequately police their platforms. 

Overall, the article serves as a reminder that technology is not a neutral tool in the conflict. While it can be used for good, it can also be used to spread propaganda and misinformation. As the conflict in Ukraine continues, it is important to be aware of the role that technology is playing, and to be critical of the information that is being presented.
