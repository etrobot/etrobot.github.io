## Introduction
The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has been making headlines for years now. With the advent of technology, one would expect the conflict to become more transparent, but that's not the case. In the article titled "In Ukraine, Technology Only Thickens the Fog of War" by Leonid Bershidsky on Bloomberg.com, the author argues that technology has only made it harder to understand what's happening on the ground. In this blog post, we will review Bershidsky's article and discuss its main points.

## The Article's Main Points
Bershidsky starts by pointing out that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been called the "first Tik Tok war." This is because there are a wealth of satellite images and social media posts from the front lines. However, the article argues that technology has only made it harder to understand what's happening on the ground. One of the main reasons for this is the use of technology to spread disinformation and propaganda. Bershidsky notes that both sides in the conflict are guilty of this, with Russia using state-sponsored media outlets to spread false information while Ukraine relies on social media to do the same.

Bershidsky also discusses how technology has made it easier for both sides to monitor the other's movements. For example, drones and satellites can be used to track troop movements and gather intelligence. However, this has also led to an increase in the use of electronic warfare, such as GPS jamming and cyber attacks.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, Bershidsky's article highlights the challenges of using technology in times of war. While it has the potential to make conflicts more transparent, it can also be used to spread disinformation and propaganda. Moreover, it can lead to an increase in electronic warfare, which can be just as deadly as traditional warfare. As we continue to rely on technology in our daily lives, it's important to remember its potential downsides, especially in times of conflict.
