## ECB Concerned About Inflation

The European Central Bank (ECB) is concerned about the path of inflation, according to the minutes of its May policy meeting. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose to 3.8% in May from 3.5% in April. This was the highest level since December 2012.

ECB President Christine Lagarde has said that the central bank will raise interest rates until inflation is back under control. The next chance for the ECB to raise rates will come on June 15.

The ECB is also winding down its bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing (QE). The program is due to end by the end of June.

The ECB's comments suggest that it is committed to fighting inflation, even if it risks slowing economic growth.

### What does this mean for you?

If you are a consumer, you may see higher prices for goods and services in the near future. If you are an investor, you may want to consider adjusting your portfolio to account for the rising interest rates.

The ECB's decision to raise interest rates is a sign that it is taking inflation seriously. However, it remains to be seen how effective the central bank will be in bringing inflation under control.
