## Australia News Today

* **New Zealand economy slows down:** The New Zealand economy grew by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2023, down from 0.9% in the previous quarter. The slowdown was due to a number of factors, including the war in Ukraine and rising interest rates.
* **Australian consumers feel the pinch of inflation:** Australian consumers are feeling the pinch of inflation, with the cost of living rising at its fastest pace in 20 years. This is leading to a slowdown in spending.
* **Melbourne man charged with art fraud:** A Melbourne man has been charged with fraud after allegedly selling fake artworks worth millions of dollars. The man is accused of selling paintings that were either copies or forgeries.

The New Zealand economy is facing a number of headwinds, including the war in Ukraine, rising interest rates, and a slowdown in China. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to raise interest rates again in July, which will put further pressure on the economy.

Australian consumers are feeling the pinch of inflation, with the Consumer Price Index rising by 5.1% in the year to March. This is the fastest pace of inflation since 2001. The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to raise interest rates again in July, which will put further pressure on household budgets.

The alleged art fraud case is the latest in a series of high-profile art fraud cases in Australia. In 2019, a Sydney art dealer was sentenced to 10 years in prison for selling fake Aboriginal paintings.
