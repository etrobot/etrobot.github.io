## Oversight Board Expands to Include More Social Media Companies

The Oversight Board, an independent body that reviews content moderation decisions made by Meta, will now be able to expand its scope to include other social media companies. The move comes as part of a new EU law called the Digital Services Act, which is designed to regulate large online platforms and protect users from harmful content.

The Oversight Board was initially limited to reviewing content moderation decisions made by Meta, but the new law will allow it to review decisions made by any large online platform with over 45 million users in the EU. This includes companies like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.

The Oversight Board is a significant step towards holding social media companies accountable for their content moderation decisions. It is also a sign that regulators are taking the issue of online harms seriously.

The Digital Services Act requires large online platforms to remove illegal content within 24 hours of being notified of it. It also requires platforms to be more transparent about how they moderate content and to give users more control over their data. The law is expected to come into effect in 2024.

The Digital Services Act is a significant piece of legislation that could have a major impact on the way social media companies operate. It is a sign that regulators are taking the issue of online harms seriously and are willing to take action to protect users.
