## The Case for Banning TikTok and Other Socials for Kids Under 16

Social media has become a ubiquitous part of our lives, but it is important to remember that it is not without its risks. In particular, social media can have a negative impact on children's mental health, well-being, and data privacy.

A number of studies have shown that social media use can lead to increased levels of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem in children. For example, a study published in the journal "Pediatrics" found that children who used social media for more than two hours per day were more likely to experience symptoms of depression than children who did not use social media.

Social media can also lead to cyberbullying, which is a serious problem that can have a devastating impact on children's mental health. Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place online or through electronic devices, such as cell phones, computers, and tablets. Cyberbullying can include sending mean or threatening messages, posting embarrassing photos or videos, or spreading rumors online.

In addition to the risks to mental health, social media can also pose a threat to children's data privacy. Social media companies collect data about children's online activity, such as the websites they visit, the apps they use, and the people they interact with. This data can be used to target children with advertising, or to track their online behavior.

Given the risks to children's mental health, well-being, and data privacy, it is important to consider raising the minimum age for using social media from 13 to 16. This would give children's brains more time to develop and would help to protect them from the risks associated with social media use.

It is also important for parents and policy makers to be aware of the risks associated with social media use and to take steps to protect children from them. Parents can talk to their children about the risks of social media and can set limits on their children's use of social media. Policy makers can consider enacting laws that would ban social media use for children under a certain age.

By taking these steps, we can help to protect children from the risks associated with social media use.
