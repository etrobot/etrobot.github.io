The European Union is in talks with member states to increase the bloc's renewable energy target to 40% by 2030. The current target is 32%.

The talks are being led by Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson. Simson said on Tuesday that she is confident that a deal can be reached. She said that the EU is "on track" to meet its 2030 climate goals. However, she said that more needs to be done to accelerate the transition to a clean energy future.

The article also mentions that the EU is considering a number of measures to boost the use of renewable energy, including:

* Increasing subsidies for renewable energy projects
* Setting stricter emissions standards for vehicles and buildings
* Investing in research and development of new renewable energy technologies

The article concludes by saying that the EU is facing a "race against time" to meet its climate goals. However, it says that the bloc is "on the right track" and that a deal on a 40% renewable energy target is within reach.
