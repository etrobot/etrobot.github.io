## Ukraine Dam Collapse Could Lead to Global Food Shortage

A dam in Ukraine collapsed due to Russian shelling, causing a major disruption to food production in the country. The dam collapse is expected to reduce Ukraine's wheat production by 20%, and could lead to a global wheat shortage.

The war in Ukraine is also disrupting global fertilizer supplies, which could further impact food production. The food shortages could lead to higher food prices and increased hunger around the world.

The article also discusses the potential impact of the dam collapse on the global food supply chain. The collapse is expected to disrupt the flow of wheat and other agricultural products from Ukraine, which could lead to higher prices and shortages.

The food shortages could have a significant impact on people around the world. Higher food prices could make it difficult for people to afford food, and increased hunger could lead to malnutrition and other health problems.
