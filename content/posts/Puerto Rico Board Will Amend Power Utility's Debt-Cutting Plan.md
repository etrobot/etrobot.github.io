## Puerto Rico Board Amends Power Utility's Debt-Cutting Plan

The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) board has announced that it will amend the debt-cutting plan for the island's power utility, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA).

The amendment is being made in response to concerns from bondholders and other stakeholders about the plan's financial viability. The amendment is expected to include changes to the plan's debt restructuring terms, as well as new provisions aimed at improving PREPA's operational efficiency.

The amendment to PREPA's debt-cutting plan is a significant development in the ongoing effort to restructure the utility's debt. The amendment is expected to address some of the concerns that have been raised about the plan, and it could help to pave the way for PREPA to emerge from bankruptcy.

### Key Points

* The amendment is being made in response to concerns from bondholders and other stakeholders about the plan's financial viability.
* The amendment is expected to include changes to the plan's debt restructuring terms, as well as new provisions aimed at improving PREPA's operational efficiency.
* The amendment is still being finalized, and it is not clear when it will be implemented.

### Details

* **The amendment is being made in response to concerns from bondholders and other stakeholders about the plan's financial viability.** The PROMESA board has received feedback from a number of stakeholders, including bondholders, creditors, and environmental groups. These stakeholders have expressed concerns about the plan's financial viability, as well as its potential impact on the environment.
* **The amendment is expected to include changes to the plan's debt restructuring terms, as well as new provisions aimed at improving PREPA's operational efficiency.** The details of the amendment have not yet been finalized, but it is expected to include changes to the plan's debt restructuring terms. These changes could include extending the repayment period for PREPA's debt, reducing the amount of debt that PREPA is required to repay, or providing PREPA with additional financial assistance. The amendment is also expected to include new provisions aimed at improving PREPA's operational efficiency. These provisions could include measures to reduce electricity consumption, improve the reliability of the power grid, or reduce the cost of operating the utility.
* **The amendment is still being finalized, and it is not clear when it will be implemented.** The PROMESA board is still finalizing the amendment to PREPA's debt-cutting plan. Once the amendment is finalized, it will need to be approved by the board and by a majority of PREPA's creditors. The amendment is not expected to be implemented until all of these steps have been completed.

### Impact

The amendment to PREPA's debt-cutting plan could have a significant impact on the island's economy. If the amendment is successful in reducing PREPA's debt burden, it could free up resources that could be used to invest in the island's infrastructure and economy. However, if the amendment is not successful, it could lead to further financial problems for PREPA and the island as a whole.

### Next Steps

The PROMESA board is expected to release more details about the amendment to PREPA's debt-cutting plan in the coming weeks. Once the amendment is finalized, it will need to be approved by the board and by a majority of PREPA's creditors. The amendment is not expected to be implemented until all of these steps have been completed.
