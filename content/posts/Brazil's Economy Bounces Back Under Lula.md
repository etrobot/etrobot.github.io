Brazil's economy bounced back in the first quarter of 2023, growing at an annualized rate of 1.2%. This defied expectations that the economy would contract, and was driven by a rebound in consumer spending and investment. The unemployment rate fell to 10.5% in April, the lowest level in two years.

President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva has credited his government's policies with the economic recovery. However, some economists warn that the growth could be short-lived, as the central bank is raising interest rates to combat inflation.

The Brazilian economy contracted by 0.4% in 2022, its first annual decline since 2015. The central bank has raised interest rates by 10.75 percentage points since March 2022 in an effort to bring inflation under control. Inflation in Brazil is currently at a 20-year high of 12.13%.

Lula has pledged to lower interest rates and increase government spending if he is re-elected in October.

Overall, the article suggests that Brazil's economy is on the mend, but there are still some risks ahead. The central bank's efforts to combat inflation could slow economic growth, and Lula's economic policies could face resistance from Congress.
