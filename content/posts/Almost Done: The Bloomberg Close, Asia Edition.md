Markets in Asia were mixed on Tuesday as investors awaited the outcome of the US Federal Reserve's meeting. The Nikkei 225 in Japan was down 0.3%, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was up 0.2%.

The US dollar was stronger against most currencies, as investors expected the Fed to raise interest rates by 0.75%. The euro was down 0.5% against the dollar, while the British pound was down 0.6%.

Oil prices were up slightly, as traders bet that the global economy will continue to grow despite the Fed's rate hike. Brent crude oil was up 0.2% to $122 per barrel.

Gold prices were down slightly, as investors moved away from safe-haven assets. Gold was down 0.1% to $1,830 per ounce.

The article also mentions that the Chinese government is planning to release a stimulus package in order to boost the economy. This could have a positive impact on markets in Asia. However, the article also notes that the global economy is facing a number of headwinds, such as rising inflation and the war in Ukraine. These factors could weigh on markets in the near term.
