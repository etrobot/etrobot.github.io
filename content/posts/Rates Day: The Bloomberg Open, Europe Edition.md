## Europe's Central Banks to Raise Interest Rates

**June 14, 2023**

Central banks in Europe are expected to raise interest rates this week in an effort to combat rising inflation. The European Central Bank (ECB) is widely expected to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday, while the Bank of England (BoE) is expected to raise rates by 0.25 or 0.5 percentage points on Wednesday.

The rate hikes are being driven by high inflation. Inflation in the eurozone is currently at a record high of 8.1%, while inflation in the UK is at 9%. The rate hikes are likely to have a negative impact on economic growth. Higher interest rates will make it more expensive for businesses to borrow money, which could lead to slower investment and hiring. The rate hikes are also likely to lead to higher mortgage rates. This could make it more difficult for people to buy homes, which could dampen the housing market.

Overall, the rate hikes by central banks in Europe are a sign that they are taking the threat of inflation seriously. However, the rate hikes are also likely to have a negative impact on economic growth.
