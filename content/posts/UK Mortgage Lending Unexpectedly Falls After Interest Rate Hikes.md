## UK Mortgage Lending Falls Unexpectedly After Interest Rate Hikes

Mortgage lending in the UK fell unexpectedly in April, after the Bank of England raised interest rates for the fifth time in a row.

Lenders authorized 48,700 home loans in April, down sharply from the 51,500 approved in March. Economists had expected mortgage lending to remain unchanged in April.

The fall in mortgage lending is a sign that the property market is slowing down. The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates again in July, which could further dampen demand for mortgages.

The article also mentions that borrowers repaid debt at a historic pace in April, which could be a sign that people are preparing for a slowdown in the economy.

Overall, the article suggests that the UK property market is facing headwinds, and that the Bank of England's tightening cycle is likely to continue to weigh on demand for mortgages.

### What does this mean for homebuyers?

Homebuyers looking to buy a property in the UK may face more challenges in the coming months. Rising interest rates will make it more expensive to borrow money, and the slowdown in the property market could lead to fewer homes on the market.

Homebuyers should be prepared to act quickly when they find a property they like, and they should be prepared to negotiate on price. They should also make sure they have a good understanding of their finances and that they can afford the monthly mortgage payments.

### What does this mean for the UK economy?

The slowdown in the property market could have a negative impact on the UK economy. The property market is a major driver of economic growth, and a slowdown in the market could lead to job losses and a decline in consumer spending.

The Bank of England is trying to balance the need to control inflation with the need to avoid a recession. It is unclear how long the Bank of England will continue to raise interest rates, but it is likely that the property market will remain under pressure in the near term.
