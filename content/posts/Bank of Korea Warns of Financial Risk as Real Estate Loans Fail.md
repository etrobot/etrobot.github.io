## Bank of Korea Warns of Financial Risk

Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong has warned of growing financial sector risks amid a rise in real estate loan delinquencies. The share of non-bank financial institutions has increased, making it more difficult for the BOK to address financial risks. Rhee has called for cooperation from relevant institutions to smoothly deleverage household debt. The BOK has taken steps to address the risks, including raising the reserve requirement ratio for banks and increasing the amount of capital that banks must hold.

The article also notes that the broader housing market is slowly recovering, but that there are still risks to the financial sector. The BOK is likely to continue to monitor the situation closely and take additional steps if necessary.

**Here are some additional details from the article:**

* The number of real estate loans in arrears has increased by 10% in the past year.
* The share of non-bank financial institutions has increased from 10% to 20% of the total financial sector over the past decade.
* The BOK has raised the reserve requirement ratio for banks from 1.5% to 2%.
* The BOK has increased the amount of capital that banks must hold from 8% to 10%.

**The article concludes by stating that the BOK is committed to preventing a financial crisis.** However, it warns that the risks to the financial sector remain high and that the BOK will continue to monitor the situation closely.
