## Student Loan Debt and Housing Crisis Slamming Young People

Young people in the United States are facing a double whammy of high student loan debt and rising housing prices. The average student loan debt for a college graduate is now over \$30,000, and the median home price is now over \$400,000. This makes it difficult for young people to save for a down payment on a home, or even to afford rent. This is contributing to a trend of young people delaying major life milestones, such as buying a home and starting a family.

Some experts argue that the government needs to do more to help young people with their student loan debt and housing costs. One way the government could help is by providing more student loan forgiveness programs. Another way the government could help is by building more affordable housing.

The student loan debt crisis is particularly acute for Black and Hispanic borrowers. The rising cost of housing is disproportionately affecting young people in urban areas. Some young people are turning to alternative forms of housing, such as co-living and renting rooms in shared homes.
