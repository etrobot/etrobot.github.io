## Texas Considers Reforming Tax Incentives for Work From Home

The Texas legislature is considering a bill that would reform the state's tax incentives for companies that allow employees to work from home. The bill would require companies to count remote workers as long as they live in Texas and within 25 miles of the office. The bill is aimed at recouping some of the $20 million in tax revenue that the state lost last year when employees began working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The bill has been met with mixed reactions from businesses and workers. Some businesses say the bill would make it more difficult for them to attract and retain employees, while others say it is fair to make companies pay taxes on all of their employees, regardless of where they work. Workers who live in Texas and within 25 miles of their office could see their paychecks increase if the bill is passed.

The bill is still in the legislative process, and it is not yet clear whether it will be passed. However, the debate over the bill highlights the growing importance of remote work and the challenges that states face in adapting their tax laws to the changing workforce.
