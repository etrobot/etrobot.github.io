Private lenders Apollo Global Management and Blackstone Inc. are exploring financing options with publicly listed companies in Europe as borrowing costs spiked and equity valuations fell. This move comes amid growing concerns about the banking industry as traditional banks struggle with a range of issues, including low interest rates, rising competition from fintech startups, and mounting regulatory pressures.

The two firms are among the largest players in the private debt market, with combined assets of over $1 trillion as of the end of 2021. Private credit funds have seen significant growth in recent years, expanding by 8.9% in 2022 alone. As traditional banks struggle to adapt to changing market conditions, private lenders like Apollo and Blackstone are stepping in to fill the gap.

Apollo and Blackstone are not the only firms turning to private debt amid the current financial crisis. As reported in the New York Times, the turmoil in the banking industry is paving the way for even bigger "shadow banks" that operate outside the traditional banking system[^4^][4]. Private debt funds are also becoming increasingly popular with investors, offering higher returns than traditional fixed income products with lower volatility than equities.

The trend towards private debt is likely to continue as long as traditional banks remain under pressure. For companies looking for alternative sources of financing, private lenders like Apollo and Blackstone offer a range of options, from senior secured loans to mezzanine debt and distressed debt. As the banking industry continues to grapple with challenges, private debt is emerging as a viable alternative for both borrowers and investors alike.
