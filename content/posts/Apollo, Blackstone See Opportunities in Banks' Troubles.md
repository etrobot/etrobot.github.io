In recent news, Apollo, Blackstone, and other private credit funds have expressed interest in the banking industry as banks face struggles in the current economic climate. According to Bloomberg, Apollo and Blackstone are among firms pitching private debt to public companies, while also bidding for assets from Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) [1][2][3][4][5].

Private credit funds have reportedly seen immense growth, with $1 trillion in assets at the end of 2021 and an additional 8.9% growth in 2022 [4]. This growth is attributed to the current economic climate, which has caused banks to tighten their lending standards, leading to increased demand for alternative financing options from private credit funds [6].

The interest from Apollo and Blackstone in the banking industry comes at a time when many are predicting the rise of "shadow banks" - non-bank financial institutions that provide similar services to traditional banks, but are not subject to the same regulations [6]. As traditional banks struggle to navigate the current economic climate, shadow banks may step in to fill the gap, potentially leading to increased competition in the industry.

Overall, the interest from private credit funds like Apollo and Blackstone in the banking industry signals a potential shift in the financial landscape. As banks face struggles in the current economic climate, alternative financing options may become increasingly important, leading to increased competition and the potential rise of shadow banks.
