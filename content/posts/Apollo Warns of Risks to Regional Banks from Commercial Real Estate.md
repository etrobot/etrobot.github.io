## Apollo Warns of Risks to Regional Banks from Commercial Real Estate

Apollo Global Management Inc.'s chief economist, Torsten Slok, has warned that regional banks could be vulnerable to a decline in commercial real estate prices.

Slok says that regional banks have lent heavily to commercial real estate developers, and that these loans could become sour if property values decline.

Slok's warning comes as the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. Rising interest rates could make it more difficult for borrowers to repay their loans, which could lead to defaults and losses for regional banks.

The article also mentions that Apollo has been selling its exposure to commercial real estate loans in recent months. This suggests that Apollo is concerned about the risks posed by the sector.

It remains to be seen whether regional banks will be able to weather a decline in commercial real estate prices. However, Slok's warning is a reminder that the sector is a potential risk for regional banks.
