Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser visited China this week, meeting with Chinese officials and executives to discuss potential areas of cooperation.

Fraser's visit comes as China's economy is showing signs of recovery, and as the country's government is looking to open up its financial markets to foreign investment.

Wall Street banks have been eager to expand their presence in China, but they have faced a number of challenges, including regulatory hurdles and political tensions.

However, Fraser's visit is a sign that Wall Street is still interested in China, and that it believes the opportunities outweigh the risks.

During her visit, Fraser met with China's Vice Premier Liu He, the country's top economic official. She also met with representatives from the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

Fraser discussed the potential for increased cooperation between Citigroup and Chinese banks in areas such as investment banking, asset management, and corporate lending. She also stressed the importance of regulatory cooperation and transparency.

China is a major market for Citigroup, and the bank has been operating in the country for over 30 years. The bank has a strong presence in China's financial markets, and it provides a wide range of services to Chinese businesses and investors.

Fraser's visit is a sign that Citigroup is committed to China, and that it believes the country will continue to be an important market for the bank.
