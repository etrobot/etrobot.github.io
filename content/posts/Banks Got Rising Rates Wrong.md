## Banks Scramble to Adjust to Rising Interest Rates

The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. The Fed has raised rates four times since March 2022, and is expected to continue raising rates in the coming months. This has led to a number of problems for banks, including:

* Increased funding costs
* Lower profitability
* Increased risk of defaults

Banks are now scrambling to adjust to the new reality of higher rates. Some banks are raising their own interest rates, while others are trying to cut costs. It remains to be seen how well banks will be able to weather the storm.
