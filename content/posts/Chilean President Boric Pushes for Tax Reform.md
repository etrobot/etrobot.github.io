## Chilean President Boric Pushes for Tax Reform

Chilean President Gabriel Boric has pressed for the need for tax reform to fund social programs and transition to a green economy.

Boric said that the current tax system is "unfair" and "inefficient," and that it needs to be reformed in order to generate more revenue for the government.

The proposed tax reform would raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations, and it would also create a new tax on carbon emissions.

Boric said that the tax reform is necessary to fund social programs such as universal healthcare and education, and to transition to a green economy.

The tax reform is facing opposition from some sectors, but Boric has said that he is committed to passing it.
