## Hedge Funds Increase Bullish Bets on Oil

Hedge funds have increased their bullish bets on oil prices in recent weeks, amid Saudi Arabia's surprise decision to cut oil output.

The number of hedge funds with bullish bets on oil rose to 72 in the week ended June 6, from 66 in the previous week, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The increase in bullish bets comes after Saudi Arabia announced on June 5 that it would cut oil output by 500,000 barrels per day in July and August.

The move by Saudi Arabia is seen as an attempt to boost oil prices, which have fallen sharply in recent months.

The price of Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, fell to a 13-month low of $61.67 per barrel on June 1.

The price of oil has since rebounded, but it remains to be seen whether the Saudi-led cuts will be enough to sustain a rally.

The increase in hedge fund bullish bets is a sign that investors are expecting oil prices to rise in the near future. The Saudi-led cuts could help to boost oil prices, but it is too early to say whether they will be enough to sustain a rally.

Here are some of the key things to watch for in the oil market:

* The outcome of the OPEC+ meeting on June 22.
* The demand for oil from China and India.
* The impact of the US-Iran nuclear deal on oil prices.

The oil market is likely to remain volatile in the near future. However, the increase in hedge fund bullish bets suggests that investors are optimistic about the outlook for oil prices.
