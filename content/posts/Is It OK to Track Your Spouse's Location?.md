Tracking your spouse's location can be a slippery slope. It can start out as a way to keep tabs on them, but it can quickly turn into a way to control them.

If you're thinking about tracking your spouse's location, it's important to have a conversation with them first. Make sure they're comfortable with it, and that they understand why you want to do it.

If you do decide to track your spouse's location, be careful not to become obsessed with it. It's important to trust your spouse, and to give them the benefit of the doubt.

If you find yourself constantly checking your spouse's location, or if you're using it to control them, it's time to stop. Tracking your spouse's location is not a healthy way to maintain a relationship.
