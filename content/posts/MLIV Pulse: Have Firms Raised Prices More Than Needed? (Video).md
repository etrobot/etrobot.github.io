## Have Firms Raised Prices More Than Needed?

A recent survey of investors by Bloomberg's Markets Live Pulse found that 90% believe companies have raised prices in excess of their own costs since the pandemic began in 2020. Almost four out of five investors said that tight monetary policy is the right way to tackle profit-led inflation.

The survey comes amid one of the worst bouts of inflation in decades, which has spurred a search for explanations. Broken supply chains, big-spending governments, and rising wages have all been blamed, but the surge in corporate markups is another potential cause that is now getting more attention.

The survey found that investors believe firms have raised prices by an average of 10% more than they needed to. Investors also said that they believe the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates by 75 basis points at its next meeting in July.

The survey results suggest that investors are concerned about the impact of inflation on the economy and are looking for the Fed to take aggressive action to bring it under control.
