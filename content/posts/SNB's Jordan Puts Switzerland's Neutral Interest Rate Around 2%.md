## SNB's Jordan Puts Switzerland's Neutral Interest Rate Around 2%

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has kept its benchmark interest rate at -0.75%, but President Thomas Jordan said that the neutral interest rate for Switzerland is around 2%. This suggests that the SNB is ready to raise interest rates in the near future, as inflation in Switzerland is running at its highest level in years.

The neutral interest rate is the level at which monetary policy is neither stimulating nor restraining economic growth. It is often described as the "natural" level of interest rates. In Switzerland, inflation is currently running at 2.9%, which is its highest level in years. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to raise interest rates in July for the first time in 11 years. This is likely to put further pressure on the SNB to raise rates, as it does not want to see the Swiss franc appreciate too much against the euro.

The SNB is likely to raise interest rates gradually, as it does not want to risk disrupting the Swiss economy. However, it is clear that the SNB is facing increasing pressure to raise rates, as inflation in Switzerland continues to rise.
