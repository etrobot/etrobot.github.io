In a recent article published on Bloomberg, the author argues that the US and its allies should not dismiss China's calls for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Despite continuing to ship weapons to Ukraine, the author suggests that the US and its European allies should be encouraging deeper Chinese engagement in Ukraine.

The article points out that China has been making efforts to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. Given Xi's leverage over Putin, the author believes that Chinese involvement will be necessary to reach any durable settlement in Ukraine. The author argues that the US and Europe should harness China's peace bid and work with China towards a peaceful resolution in Ukraine.

It is not surprising that the US has been wary of China's involvement in Ukraine. The US has been at odds with China on various issues, including trade, human rights, and military expansion in the South China Sea. However, the article suggests that the US should put aside its differences with China and work towards a common goal of peace in Ukraine.

The article also highlights the risks associated with the current approach of the US and its allies. Continuing to supply weapons to Ukraine may escalate the conflict further and could lead to a wider war. The author suggests that it is time for the US and its European allies to reassess their strategy towards Ukraine and consider the role of China in bringing about a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

In conclusion, the article makes a strong case for why the US and its allies should not dismiss China's calls for a ceasefire in Ukraine. By working with China towards a peaceful resolution, the US and its allies can avoid the risks associated with the current approach and bring an end to the conflict in Ukraine.
