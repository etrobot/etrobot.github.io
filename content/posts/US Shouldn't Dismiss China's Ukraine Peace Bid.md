On May 16, 2023, Bloomberg published an op-ed titled "US Shouldn't Dismiss China's Ukraine Peace Bid," which argues that the United States and its allies should not dismiss China's proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Instead, the US should engage with China to turn its rhetoric of peace into action.

Ambassador Li's tour of Europe was seen by some as a cynical ploy by China to extend its influence in the region. However, the article argues that China's proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine should be viewed as a shared interest in peace and stability in Europe. The US and Europe should use this opportunity to engage with China and work towards de-escalating the conflict in Ukraine.

This is not the first time that China has proposed a peace initiative for Ukraine. In March 2023, Bloomberg published another op-ed titled "US and Europe Should Harness China's Ukraine Peace Bid," which argued that the US and Europe should work with China to achieve peace in Ukraine. However, the US dismissed China's proposal as a "cynical ploy" in February 2023, according to a Politico article.

It is important for the US to consider China's proposal seriously. The conflict in Ukraine has been ongoing for years, and the US and its allies have been unable to find a solution. China's proposal could provide a new approach to resolving the conflict. Moreover, engaging with China on a shared interest in peace and stability could also help improve US-China relations, which have been strained in recent years.

In conclusion, the US and its allies should not dismiss China's proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Instead, they should engage with China to turn its rhetoric of peace into action. This could provide a new approach to resolving the conflict in Ukraine and could also improve US-China relations.
