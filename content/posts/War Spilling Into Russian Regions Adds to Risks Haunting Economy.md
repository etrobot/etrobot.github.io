The war in Ukraine is having a devastating impact on the Russian economy. The conflict has disrupted supply chains, led to shortages of goods and services, and caused inflation to soar. The Russian government has taken steps to try to mitigate the damage, but these measures have so far been largely unsuccessful. The war is also having a negative impact on the Russian stock market and currency. The longer the war drags on, the more likely it is that the Russian economy will suffer.

Here are some of the key ways in which the war is impacting the Russian economy:

* **Supply chain disruptions:** The war has disrupted the production and transportation of goods, leading to shortages of everything from food to electronics.
* **Inflation:** Inflation in Russia has reached a 20-year high, and the central bank has been forced to raise interest rates in an attempt to curb price growth.
* **Foreign investment and trade:** The Russian government has imposed a number of restrictions on foreign investment and trade, which has further damaged the economy.
* **Stock market and currency:** The Russian stock market has lost half of its value since the start of the war, and the ruble has fallen to its lowest level in decades.

The war in Ukraine is having a significant impact on the Russian economy. The longer the war drags on, the more likely it is that the Russian economy will suffer.
