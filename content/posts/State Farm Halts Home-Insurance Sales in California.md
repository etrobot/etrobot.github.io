**State Farm Halts Home-Insurance Sales in California**

State Farm, the largest home insurer in the United States, has halted new home-insurance sales in California. The move is a blow to the state's efforts to maintain a vibrant market for homeowners in the wildfire-prone state.

State Farm cited the rising cost of claims as the reason for the decision. The company said that it would continue to insure existing customers in California.

The decision by State Farm is likely to make it more difficult for Californians to find affordable home insurance. It is also likely to lead to higher premiums for those who can find coverage.

The move by State Farm is a sign of the challenges that insurers face in California. The state is home to some of the most expensive homes in the country, and it is also one of the most wildfire-prone states. This combination of factors has made it difficult for insurers to make a profit in California.

The decision by State Farm is likely to put pressure on other insurers to follow suit. If this happens, it could make it even more difficult for Californians to find affordable home insurance.
