The stock market opened higher on June 14, as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. The S&P 500 was also up in early trading, while the Nasdaq Composite was slightly lower. Investors are looking for clues about the Fed's plans to combat inflation, which is running at a 40-year high. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates by 0.5 percentage points at its meeting on Wednesday. This would be the largest rate hike since 2000. Investors are also watching for any signs that the Fed is considering a more aggressive rate-hike schedule. A more aggressive rate-hike schedule could weigh on stocks. However, if the Fed signals that it is willing to take a more cautious approach, it could boost stocks. Overall, the stock market is expected to be volatile in the near term as investors await the Fed's decision on interest rates.
