## OpenAI CEO Calls for Collaboration With China to Counter AI Risks

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has called for collaboration between the United States and China on artificial intelligence (AI). Altman believes that AI is a "global problem" that requires a "global solution." He argues that the United States and China should work together to develop AI safety standards and to ensure that AI is used for good.

Altman's comments come as the United States and China are increasingly competing in the AI space. The United States has imposed sanctions on Chinese AI companies, and China has accused the United States of trying to contain its AI progress. Altman believes that collaboration is the best way to address the risks and challenges posed by AI.

**Here are some additional details about the key points:**

* **AI is a global problem:** AI is a technology that has the potential to impact everyone on the planet. It is therefore important that the development and use of AI be done in a way that benefits all of humanity.
* **Global solution:** The challenges posed by AI are too big for any one country to solve on its own. Therefore, it is essential that countries work together to develop AI safety standards and to ensure that AI is used for good.
* **United States and China:** The United States and China are the two leading countries in the AI space. As such, it is important that these two countries work together to address the risks and challenges posed by AI.
* **Collaboration:** Altman believes that collaboration is the best way to address the risks and challenges posed by AI. He argues that the United States and China can learn from each other and work together to develop AI that is safe and beneficial for all.

**Overall, Altman's comments are a call for the United States and China to put aside their differences and work together to address the risks and challenges posed by AI. He believes that collaboration is the best way to ensure that AI is used for good and that it does not pose a threat to humanity.**
