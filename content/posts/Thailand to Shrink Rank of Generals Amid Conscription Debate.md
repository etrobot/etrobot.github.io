## Thailand to Shrink Rank of Generals Amid Conscription Debate

Thailand's defense ministry has announced plans to slash the number of army generals by 50% over the next four years. The move comes amid a debate over conscription, with a coalition of pro-democracy parties that won the May election pledging to end the practice and reduce military spending.

Conscription has been in place in Thailand for over 70 years, and requires all men between the ages of 21 and 27 to serve in the military for one year. The move to reduce the number of generals is seen as a way to save money and make the military more efficient. It is also seen as a way to appease the pro-democracy parties, who have long criticized the military's role in Thai politics.

The defense ministry has said that the reduction in the number of generals will not affect the military's ability to defend the country. The ministry has also said that it will be looking at ways to reduce the number of soldiers in the military, without compromising its effectiveness.

The debate over conscription is likely to continue in Thailand. The pro-democracy parties have pledged to end the practice, but the military has said that it is necessary to maintain national security. The outcome of the debate will have a significant impact on the future of the Thai military.
