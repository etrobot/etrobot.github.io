**Chinese Data Provider Wind Limits Information for Foreign Users**

Wind Information, a Chinese data provider, has quietly limited the information that foreign users can access. This includes data on e-commerce shopping trends and satellite images. The move has clouded the view of the world's second-largest economy for foreign investors and analysts.

It is unclear why Wind has made this change. Some analysts believe that it is an attempt to protect Chinese companies from foreign competition. Others believe that it is a way for the Chinese government to exert more control over the flow of information.

Wind Information is a private Shanghai-based company that provides financial data to banks, securities firms and money managers. It is one of the largest data providers in China, and its products are used by a wide range of clients, including foreign investors and analysts.

The company's decision to limit access to information for foreign users is a significant development. It is the first time that a major Chinese data provider has taken such a step. The move is likely to have a significant impact on foreign investors and analysts who rely on Wind's data to make investment decisions. It is also likely to raise concerns about the Chinese government's willingness to restrict access to information.
