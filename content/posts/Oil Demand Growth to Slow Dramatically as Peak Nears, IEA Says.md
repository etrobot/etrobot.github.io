## Oil Demand Growth to Slow Dramatically

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has forecast that global oil demand growth will slow dramatically in the coming years, reaching a peak in 2028. The IEA expects global oil demand to grow by an average of 0.9% per year between 2023 and 2028. This growth will be driven by demand from emerging markets, particularly China and India. However, demand growth will slow in developed markets, as these countries transition to cleaner energy sources.

The slowdown in oil demand growth will have a significant impact on the global oil market. Oil prices are likely to fall, and some oil producers may face financial difficulties. However, the slowdown in oil demand growth is also an opportunity for the oil industry to adapt and transition to a clean energy future.

The IEA also expects the global oil market to remain adequately supplied through to 2028. However, the market will become increasingly tight in the later years of the forecast period, as demand growth slows and production plateaus. This could lead to higher oil prices in the future.

The shift to a clean energy economy is picking up pace, with more and more countries and businesses committing to net-zero emissions by 2050. This shift is being driven by a number of factors, including the rising cost of carbon, the increasing availability of renewable energy, and the growing public concern about climate change.

The slowdown in oil demand growth is a sign of the times, and it is a reminder that the world is moving towards a cleaner energy future. The oil industry needs to adapt to this change, or it will be left behind.
