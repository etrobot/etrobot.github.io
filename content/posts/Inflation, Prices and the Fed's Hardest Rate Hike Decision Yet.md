The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points on June 15, the largest rate hike since 1994. The move is an effort to combat inflation, which is at a 40-year high.

The rate hike is likely to have a significant impact on the economy, leading to higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. It is also likely to lead to slower economic growth.

The Fed is under pressure to take decisive action to combat inflation. Inflation is causing a great deal of pain for consumers, who are seeing the prices of goods and services rise at a rapid pace. The Fed is also concerned that inflation could become entrenched, which would make it more difficult to bring it under control.

The 75 basis point rate hike is a significant departure from the Fed's previous policy of gradual rate hikes. The Fed is signaling that it is willing to take more aggressive action to combat inflation.

The rate hike is likely to have a significant impact on the economy, but it is unclear how much of an impact it will have on inflation. The economy is likely to slow down as a result of the rate hike, but it is also possible that the rate hike will help to bring inflation down. Only time will tell how effective the Fed's strategy will be.
