## Europe's Risky Plan to Avert a Winter Energy Crisis: Stash Gas in Ukraine

Europe is facing a potential winter energy crisis due to the war in Ukraine and the uncertainty of Russian gas supplies. One way to avert the crisis is to store gas in Ukraine, which has the largest underground gas storage system in Europe. However, there are risks associated with storing gas in Ukraine, including the possibility of the war spreading to the country or of Russia blocking gas exports to Ukraine. Despite the risks, European officials are considering storing gas in Ukraine as a way to ensure that they have enough gas to heat homes and businesses in the winter.

Here are some additional details from the article:

* The Bilche-Volytsko-Uherske storage facility in Ukraine can store more than four times as much natural gas as the largest site in Germany.
* Ukraine has offered to make its storage facilities available to European countries at a discounted price.
* European officials are still considering whether to support links to Bilche-Volytsko-Uherske and other facilities scattered across Ukraine.
* The decision of whether or not to store gas in Ukraine is a political one, as well as an economic one. European officials will need to weigh the risks of storing gas in Ukraine against the need to secure energy supplies for the winter.

### Risks of Storing Gas in Ukraine

There are a number of risks associated with storing gas in Ukraine, including:

* The war in Ukraine could spread to the country, which could damage or destroy the gas storage facilities.
* Russia could block gas exports to Ukraine, which would make it difficult for European countries to access the gas they need.
* Storing gas in Ukraine could be seen as a provocation by Russia, which could lead to further escalation of the conflict.

### Benefits of Storing Gas in Ukraine

There are also a number of benefits to storing gas in Ukraine, including:

* Ukraine has the largest underground gas storage system in Europe, which could provide European countries with a secure source of gas.
* Ukraine has offered to make its storage facilities available to European countries at a discounted price.
* Storing gas in Ukraine could help to reduce European dependence on Russian gas.

### Conclusion

The decision of whether or not to store gas in Ukraine is a difficult one. There are both risks and benefits associated with this option. European officials will need to weigh the risks against the benefits before making a decision.
