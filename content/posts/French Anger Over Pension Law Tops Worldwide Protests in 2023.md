**French Anger Over Pension Law Tops Worldwide Protests in 2023**

French President Emmanuel Macron's proposed pension reform law has sparked widespread protests across the country. The law would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 and make it harder for workers to retire early.

Protesters have blocked roads, clashed with police, and set fire to cars and buildings. The protests have caused travel chaos and disrupted businesses.

Macron has defended the reform, saying it is necessary to make the French pension system sustainable. However, the protests have shown that the reform is deeply unpopular and could damage Macron's popularity.

The protests began on December 5, 2022, and have continued for several weeks. The protests have been organized by a coalition of unions and left-wing groups.

The government has made some concessions, such as raising the minimum retirement age to 62.5 from 62. However, the protesters are demanding that the government scrap the reform altogether.

The protests have had a significant impact on the French economy. The travel chaos has caused businesses to lose money and has made it difficult for people to get to work. The protests have also damaged France's reputation as a tourist destination.

The protests are a sign of the deep divide in French society over the future of the country's pension system. The government is facing a difficult challenge in trying to reform the system without alienating too many people.
