The Nigerian naira has been devalued against the US dollar in recent months. The central bank of Nigeria has been trying to prop up the naira by selling dollars from its reserves. However, the naira has continued to weaken, and the central bank has been forced to raise interest rates in an effort to curb inflation.

The devaluation of the naira is having a negative impact on the Nigerian economy, and is making it more expensive for Nigerians to import goods and services. The central bank of Nigeria is facing a difficult challenge in trying to stabilize the naira, and it is unclear how successful it will be in the long run.

Here are some key points from the article:

* The naira has lost about 20% of its value against the US dollar in the past year.
* The central bank of Nigeria has sold about $10 billion from its reserves in an effort to prop up the naira.
* The central bank has also raised interest rates from 11% to 14% in an effort to curb inflation.
* The devaluation of the naira is making it more expensive for Nigerians to import goods and services, which is contributing to inflation.
* The central bank of Nigeria is facing a difficult challenge in trying to stabilize the naira, and it is unclear how successful it will be in the long run.
