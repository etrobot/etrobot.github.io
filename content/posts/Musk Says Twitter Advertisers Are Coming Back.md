## Elon Musk Says Twitter Advertisers Are Coming Back

Elon Musk said in an interview in Paris that he believes Twitter advertisers are coming back. Musk said that he wants to make Twitter a more attractive place for advertisers, and that he believes he can do this by making the platform more engaging and user-friendly.

Musk also said that he didn't want to be the cause of an AI apocalypse. Musk said this in response to a question about his plans for artificial intelligence. Musk said that he believes AI is a powerful technology, but that it needs to be used responsibly.

Here are some additional details from the article:

* Musk said that he believes Twitter can be a "tremendous" advertising platform.
* He said that Twitter has a large and engaged user base, and that this makes it an attractive place for advertisers to reach their target audience.
* Musk said that he plans to make Twitter more user-friendly by making it easier for users to find the content that they are interested in.
* He also said that he plans to make Twitter more engaging by adding new features, such as live video streaming.

Musk's comments about AI are in line with his previous statements on the subject. Musk has long been a vocal advocate for responsible AI development. He has said that he believes AI is a "fundamental risk to humanity" and that it needs to be developed with caution.

Musk's meeting with Arnault is significant because it suggests that he is looking for ways to partner with other companies to grow Twitter. Arnault is the CEO of LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods company. A partnership between Twitter and LVMH could help Twitter to reach a new audience of high-income consumers.
