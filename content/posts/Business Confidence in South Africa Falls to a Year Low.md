## Business Confidence in South Africa Falls to a Year Low

Business confidence in South Africa has fallen to a year low, according to a report by the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Sacci). The index compiled by Sacci fell to 106.9 in May from 107.1 a month earlier. This is the lowest level since May 2022.

Sacci said that the decline in business confidence was due to a number of factors, including the ongoing power outages, the rising cost of living, and the uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. The Chamber urged the government to take steps to address these challenges, if it wants to boost economic growth and create jobs.

The article also mentions that South Africa's relations with the US and other Western allies have come into focus in the past year because of Pretoria's stance on Russia. South Africa abstained from United Nations resolutions condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and it has also hosted naval exercises with China and Russia.

Overall, the article suggests that South Africa is facing a number of challenges, including low business confidence and strained relations with some of its key trading partners. The government will need to take steps to address these challenges if it wants to boost economic growth and create jobs.
