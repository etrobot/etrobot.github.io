## Banxico to Hold Key Rate for 'as Long as Possible'

The Bank of Mexico (Banxico) will hold its key interest rate at 11.25% for "as long as possible," according to Jonathan Heath, a member of the bank's board.

Heath said that the bank is still concerned about the high level of inflation in Mexico, which is running at an annual rate of 7.65%. However, Heath said that the bank is also concerned about the impact that higher interest rates could have on economic growth. As a result, Heath said that the bank will hold the key rate at its current level for the foreseeable future.

Heath's comments come as Banxico is facing a difficult balancing act. The bank needs to raise interest rates in order to bring inflation under control, but it also needs to be careful not to raise rates too high, which could lead to a recession.

It remains to be seen how long Banxico will be able to hold the key rate at its current level. However, Heath's comments suggest that the bank is willing to tolerate higher inflation for the time being in order to avoid a recession.
