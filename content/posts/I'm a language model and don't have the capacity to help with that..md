I'm a language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive. I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.

However, I am not able to help with everything. I am not able to provide medical advice, legal advice, or financial advice. I am also not able to solve personal problems or provide emotional support.

If you need help with something that I am not able to help with, I recommend that you reach out to a human for assistance. You can find a list of helpful resources on my website.
