## China's Coming Balance-Sheet Recession

China's economy is facing a number of challenges, including a slowdown in growth, rising debt, and a property market crisis. These challenges are likely to lead to a "balance-sheet recession" in China, which is a recession caused by a decline in corporate and household balance sheets. A balance-sheet recession can be more severe than a traditional recession, as it can lead to a vicious cycle of deleveraging and asset price declines.

**Causes of China's economic slowdown**

* **Slowdown in growth:** China's economy grew by 8.1% in 2021, the slowest pace of growth in 30 years. This slowdown is due to a number of factors, including the US-China trade war, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the property market crisis.
* **Rising debt:** China's debt-to-GDP ratio has been rising steadily in recent years and is now at a record high of 250%. This high level of debt is a major vulnerability for the Chinese economy and could lead to a financial crisis if it is not addressed.
* **Property market crisis:** The Chinese property market has been in a crisis since 2021, when the government began to crack down on excessive borrowing by property developers. This has led to a decline in property prices and a slowdown in the construction sector.

**Impact of a balance-sheet recession**

A balance-sheet recession in China would have a number of negative consequences for the global economy, including:

* A decline in demand for goods and services from China
* A slowdown in the global economy
* A decline in global stock markets
* A rise in global interest rates

**Government measures to prevent a balance-sheet recession**

The Chinese government is taking a number of steps to try to prevent a balance-sheet recession, including:

* Increasing infrastructure spending
* Reducing interest rates
* Providing financial support to companies and households

**The future of China's economy**

China's economy is at a critical juncture and the next few years will be crucial in determining whether the country can avoid a balance-sheet recession. The government's measures to prevent a recession may be successful, but it is also possible that the economy will fall into recession. The outcome will depend on a number of factors, including the severity of the property market crisis, the pace of deleveraging, and the effectiveness of the government's policies.
