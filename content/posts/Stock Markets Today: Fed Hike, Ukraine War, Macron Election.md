## Stock Markets Today: Fed Hike, Ukraine War, Macron Election

The stock market is expected to be volatile today, as investors react to a number of key events.

* The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by 0.75%, the largest rate hike in nearly 30 years. This is being done in an effort to combat inflation, which is at a 40-year high.
* The war in Ukraine is also weighing on markets. The conflict has caused energy prices to surge, which is hurting businesses and consumers.
* French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to win re-election today. This would be a positive development for markets, as it would provide stability in Europe.

Overall, investors are facing a number of headwinds today. However, there are also some positive signs, such as the expected win for Macron in France. It remains to be seen how the market will react to these events.

**Here are some additional details about each of the key points:**

* **Federal Reserve interest rate hike:** The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by 0.75% today. This is the largest rate hike in nearly 30 years and is being done in an effort to combat inflation. Inflation is at a 40-year high, and the Fed is trying to bring it under control. A higher interest rate environment will make it more expensive for businesses to borrow money, which could slow economic growth. However, it will also make it more attractive for investors to put their money in savings accounts and other safe investments, which could help to boost the value of stocks.
* **War in Ukraine:** The war in Ukraine is also weighing on markets. The conflict has caused energy prices to surge, which is hurting businesses and consumers. Oil prices are up more than 50% since the start of the war, and natural gas prices are up even more. This is driving up the cost of everything from gasoline to electricity to food. Higher energy prices are also hurting the global economy, as they are making it more expensive for businesses to produce goods and services.
* **French presidential election:** French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to win re-election today. This would be a positive development for markets, as it would provide stability in Europe. Macron is seen as a pro-business leader, and his re-election would likely lead to continued support for the European Union.

**Overall, markets are expected to be volatile today.** The Federal Reserve rate hike and the war in Ukraine are two major factors that could weigh on stocks. However, a win for Macron in France and positive news from China could help to offset some of the negative sentiment.
