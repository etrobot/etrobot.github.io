Sweden has passed a new terror law in an effort to sway Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to approve the Nordic country's accession to NATO.

The law, which was passed by the Swedish parliament on May 27, defines terrorism as "any act that is intended to create a state of terror or fear in a population or in a particular group of people." It also makes it a crime to provide financial or logistical support to a terrorist group.

Turkey has been blocking Sweden's NATO membership bid, citing concerns about Sweden's alleged support for Kurdish militants. The new terror law is seen as a sign that Sweden is taking Turkey's concerns seriously.

It is still unclear whether the new terror law will be enough to convince Erdogan to approve Sweden's NATO membership bid. Erdogan has said that he will not approve Sweden's membership until the country extradites 33 people who are wanted by Turkey on terrorism charges.

Sweden has denied that it provides support to Kurdish militants. The Swedish government has said that it is willing to extradite some of the people who are wanted by Turkey, but it has not said which ones.

The situation remains deadlocked, and it is unclear when Erdogan will make a decision on Sweden's NATO membership bid.
