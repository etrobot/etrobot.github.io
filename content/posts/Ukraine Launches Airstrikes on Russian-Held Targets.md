**Ukraine Launches Airstrikes on Russian-Held Targets**

Ukraine's armed forces launched airstrikes on 11 Russian clusters of personnel and equipment on May 27, 2023. The strikes were carried out by Ukraine's air force over the past day.

The strikes come as anticipation grows that Kyiv is on the brink of beginning a long-awaited offensive to regain lost territory. The offensive is expected to focus on the southern and eastern regions of Ukraine, which are currently under Russian control.

The offensive is likely to be a major turning point in the war, and it remains to be seen how successful it will be.

**What do you think of the airstrikes? Will they be successful in helping Ukraine regain lost territory?**
