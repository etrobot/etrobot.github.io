## Debt Averted, NATO Mulls Ukraine's Future

Ukraine avoided a default on its debt after the U.S. Treasury Department granted a waiver on a key payment deadline. The waiver allowed Ukraine to make a payment on its debt in U.S. dollars, even though the country's central bank is currently frozen out of the U.S. financial system.

NATO leaders are meeting in Madrid to discuss the war in Ukraine and the future of the alliance. The summit is expected to focus on strengthening NATO's eastern flank and providing more military aid to Ukraine.

The U.S. is sending an additional 3,000 troops to Europe in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The troops will be deployed to Romania and Poland, and they will be used to bolster NATO's defenses in the region.

China is facing growing international criticism for its support of Russia. China has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and it has blocked efforts to impose sanctions on Russia at the United Nations.

The war in Ukraine is causing a global food crisis. The war has disrupted global food production and transportation, and it has led to a sharp rise in food prices. Millions of people around the world are facing food insecurity as a result of the war.

The weekend's news shows that the war in Ukraine is having a major impact on the global economy and security. The war is also putting a strain on relations between Russia and the West. It remains to be seen how the war will develop in the coming weeks and months, but it is clear that it will have a lasting impact on the world.
