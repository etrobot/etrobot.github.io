**Russia-Ukraine War Update: June 3, 2023**

In the latest developments in the Russia-Ukraine war:

* **Russia has lost control of Snake Island.** The small island in the Black Sea was captured by Russia early in the war, but it was retaken by Ukraine on June 3, 2023.
* **Ukraine has completed a questionnaire for membership in the European Union.** This is a major step in Ukraine's long-standing bid to join the bloc.
* **The United States and Russia have held talks on strategic stability.** However, there has been little progress in resolving their differences.
* **The war in Ukraine has caused a humanitarian crisis.** Millions of people have been displaced from their homes, and thousands have been killed.
