## Mexico Pitches Automakers GM, Toyota on Developing Southern States

Mexico is in talks with General Motors (GM) and Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) about investing in a narrow strip of land in southern Mexico. The government is hoping to attract investment to the region, which has been lagging behind the rest of the country in terms of economic development.

The Interoceanic Corridor is a proposed project that would connect the Pacific and Atlantic oceans through southern Mexico. The government is hoping that the project will create jobs and boost economic growth in the region.

GM and TMC have not yet made any commitments to invest in the region. However, the government is hopeful that the Interoceanic Corridor project will be a catalyst for economic growth in the region.

### Advantages of Southern Mexico

The southern region of Mexico has several advantages, including good water supplies, and an ample availability of clean energy. However, it is a tough sell for automakers who have long preferred to build in the north for easy access to the US market.

### Government's Efforts

The Mexican government is making a concerted effort to attract investment to its less-developed southern states. The government is offering tax breaks and other incentives to potential investors. The government is also working to improve the region's infrastructure.

### Future of Southern Mexico

It remains to be seen whether GM and TMC will be willing to invest in southern Mexico. However, the government's efforts to attract investment and improve the region's infrastructure are a positive sign for the future of the region.
