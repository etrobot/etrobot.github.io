**Oil Traders Defy Saudi Arabia**

Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, has pledged to unilaterally cut its July oil production to the lowest in over a decade. However, some traders are betting that the Saudis will not be able to sustain such a large cut.

The Saudis have said that they are willing to extend the cut if necessary, but traders are skeptical. They point to the fact that the Saudis have been making a number of comments in recent months that suggest they want to hurt those who speculate on lower oil prices. This could be seen as a sign that the Saudis are willing to take a more aggressive approach to managing the oil market.

It remains to be seen whether the Saudis will be able to defy the market and maintain their production cut. If they are successful, it could send a strong signal to other producers and could help to stabilize the oil market. However, if they are unsuccessful, it could lead to a sharp rise in oil prices and could destabilize the global economy.
