## Five Things You Need to Know to Start Your Day

1. New Zealand's annual current account deficit narrowed in the first quarter of 2023. This is a positive sign for the economy, as it suggests that the economy is recovering from the pandemic.
2. The goods deficit widened in the first quarter, which suggests that imports are still outpacing exports. This could put pressure on the exchange rate and inflation in the coming months.
3. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to raise interest rates again in May. This is being done to combat inflation, which is currently at a 30-year high.
4. The government is considering a number of policies to help people with the cost of living. These include a temporary reduction in fuel excise duty and a one-off payment to low-income households.
5. The weather is expected to be mostly fine today, with a high of 22 degrees Celsius in Auckland. There is a chance of rain in Wellington, however.

Overall, it is a mixed bag of news for New Zealand today. The economy is recovering, but inflation is a concern. The Reserve Bank is taking steps to address inflation, but this could put pressure on the economy in the short term. The government is also considering a number of policies to help people with the cost of living.
