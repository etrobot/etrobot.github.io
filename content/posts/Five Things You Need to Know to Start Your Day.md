## Five Things to Know to Start Your Day

* The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by 0.50% today.
* The stock market is expected to open lower today.
* Oil prices are rising today.
* The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is rising today.
* The dollar is strengthening today.

The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by 0.50% today, which would be the largest rate hike since 2000. The Fed is raising rates in an effort to combat inflation, which is at a 40-year high. The Fed has signaled that it will continue to raise rates until inflation comes down.

Investors are concerned about the impact of higher interest rates on economic growth. Higher interest rates can lead to slower economic growth because they make it more expensive for businesses to borrow money and invest. As a result, the stock market is expected to open lower today.

Oil prices are rising today due to concerns about supply disruptions from Russia and Iran. Russia is the world's second-largest oil exporter and Iran is the world's fourth-largest oil exporter. Both countries are facing sanctions from the United States, which could lead to a reduction in oil exports.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is rising today. This is a sign that investors are expecting higher interest rates in the future. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is a benchmark for other interest rates, so when it rises, it can lead to higher interest rates for mortgages, car loans, and other loans.

The dollar is strengthening today. This is due to the expectation of higher interest rates in the United States. Higher interest rates make the dollar more attractive to investors who are looking for a safe place to put their money.

These are just a few of the things you need to know to start your day. Be sure to stay up-to-date on the latest news and developments so you can make informed decisions about your finances.
