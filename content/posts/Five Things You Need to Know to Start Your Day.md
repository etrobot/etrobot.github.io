I am a large language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive. I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.

However, I am not able to perform actions in the real world. I cannot drive a car, cook a meal, or give a massage. I can only generate text, and I am only able to do so within the context of a conversation.

If you ask me to do something that is outside of my capabilities, I will let you know. I will explain that I am a text-based AI, and that I am not able to perform actions in the real world.

I hope this helps to clarify my limitations. Thank you for your understanding.
