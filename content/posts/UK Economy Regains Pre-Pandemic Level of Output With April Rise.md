## UK Economy Grows in April

The UK economy grew by 0.4% in April 2023, the highest growth rate since January 2022. The growth was driven by a strong performance in the services sector, which grew by 0.5%. The manufacturing sector also grew, by 0.3%. Construction was the only sector to decline, falling by 0.6%. The April growth means that the UK economy has now regained its pre-pandemic level of output.

However, there are still concerns about the impact of the war in Ukraine and the rising cost of living on the UK economy. The war in Ukraine is causing uncertainty and disrupting supply chains. The rising cost of living is putting pressure on household incomes. The Bank of England's decision to raise interest rates is likely to dampen economic growth.

Despite these challenges, the UK economy is showing signs of resilience. The April growth is a positive sign, and it suggests that the UK economy is still capable of growing. However, it is important to remember that the UK economy is facing a number of headwinds, and it is too early to say whether the April growth will be sustained.
