European markets were mixed on Wednesday as investors awaited the outcome of the European Central Bank's (ECB) policy meeting. The Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 0.1% at 417.95 points by 0815 GMT.

Inditex shares rose 2.9% after the company reported a 16% rise in first-half profit. However, banks and miners weighed on the index, with HSBC down 1.2% and Rio Tinto down 1.1%.

Investors are awaiting the outcome of the ECB's policy meeting later in the day. The ECB is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged but could signal a willingness to raise rates in the coming months.

The ECB is facing a difficult balancing act. On the one hand, it needs to keep inflation in check. On the other hand, it needs to support economic growth. The ECB is likely to keep interest rates unchanged for now, but it could signal a willingness to raise rates in the coming months if inflation continues to rise.
