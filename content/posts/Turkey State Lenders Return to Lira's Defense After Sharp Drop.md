The Turkish lira recovered some ground on Thursday after the government intervened in the market to sell dollars. The lira had fallen to a record low against the US dollar on Wednesday, after the government suspended a program that allowed state lenders to sell dollars to support the currency. The government's decision to suspend the program was a surprise move that caught many market participants off guard. The program had been in place since 2018 and had been credited with helping to stabilize the lira. The government's decision to suspend the program was likely motivated by a desire to conserve its foreign exchange reserves. The government's foreign exchange reserves have been declining in recent months due to a number of factors, including the lira's depreciation and Turkey's current account deficit. The government's decision to suspend the dollar sales program is likely to have a negative impact on Turkey's economy. The lira's depreciation will make imports more expensive and could lead to higher inflation. The sell-off in Turkish assets could also damage investor confidence and make it more difficult for the government to raise money. The government's decision to suspend the dollar sales program is a sign of the challenges that Turkey faces in managing its economy.

However, the government's intervention on Thursday helped to stabilize the lira and prevent it from falling further. The lira is still trading at a weaker level than it was before the government's intervention, but it has recovered some of its losses. It remains to be seen whether the lira will be able to sustain its recovery in the long term. The government will need to take steps to address the underlying factors that have been driving the lira's depreciation, such as its current account deficit and high inflation. If the government is able to address these factors, the lira may be able to recover its value and restore investor confidence in the Turkish economy.
