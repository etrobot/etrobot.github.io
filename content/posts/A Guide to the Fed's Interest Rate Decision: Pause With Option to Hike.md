## Fed Expected to Pause Interest Rate Hikes

The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates on hold at its June meeting, according to a [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.comews/articles/2023-06-08/fed-seen-holding-rates-in-june-as-it-weighs-inflation-recession-risks) survey of economists. This would mark the first time since March 2022 that the Fed has not raised rates.

The decision to pause comes as the Fed faces conflicting pressures. On the one hand, inflation is running at a 40-year high, and the Fed is under pressure to take steps to cool it down. On the other hand, the economy is showing signs of slowing down, and the Fed is worried about raising rates too quickly and causing a recession.

By pausing, the Fed is signaling that it is willing to wait and see how the economy evolves before making any further decisions about interest rates. The Fed is expected to release a statement at 2 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 15. Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later.

In the statement, the Fed is likely to say that it is "patient" in its approach to monetary policy. This means that the Fed is not committed to raising rates at every meeting. Instead, the Fed will be looking at a range of factors, including inflation, economic growth, and employment, before making any decisions about interest rates.

The decision to pause is a sign that the Fed is taking a cautious approach to monetary policy. The Fed is worried about raising rates too quickly and causing a recession. However, the Fed is also worried about inflation, and it is not clear how long it will be able to keep rates on hold. The next few months will be critical for the Fed, as it tries to balance the risks of inflation and recession.
