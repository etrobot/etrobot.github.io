# BRICS Ministers to Challenge US With More Members, Common Currency

The BRICS bloc of emerging economies is looking to expand and create a common currency in a challenge to the US-led global order.

The bloc's foreign ministers met in Cape Town on Wednesday to discuss the expansion of the group, which currently consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.

The ministers also discussed the possibility of creating a common currency for the BRICS countries.

The move to expand the BRICS bloc and create a common currency is seen as a way for the group to challenge the US-led global order.

The US has been the dominant global power for decades, but its influence has been waning in recent years.

The BRICS countries are all large and growing economies, and they are increasingly looking to assert their own power and influence on the global stage.

The expansion of the BRICS bloc and the creation of a common currency would be a significant step in this direction.
