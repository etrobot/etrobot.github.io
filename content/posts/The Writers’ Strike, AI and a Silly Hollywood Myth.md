## The Writers’ Strike, AI, and a Silly Hollywood Myth

In 2007, Hollywood writers went on strike, shutting down production on many TV shows and movies. The strike was caused by a dispute between the writers and the studios over payment for new media, such as streaming and DVD sales. The strike lasted for 100 days and ended with the writers winning a number of concessions from the studios.

The strike had a significant impact on Hollywood, and it is often seen as a turning point in the history of the industry. The strike also had a major impact on the development of artificial intelligence (AI). During the strike, many writers turned to AI to help them with their work. This led to a number of advances in AI, and it helped to legitimize AI as a tool for writers.

Today, AI is used by writers in a variety of ways, and it is becoming increasingly important in the world of Hollywood. Some of the ways that AI is used in writing include:

* **Generating ideas:** AI can be used to generate ideas for stories, characters, and plots. This can be a great way for writers to get started on a new project or to come up with new ideas for an existing project.
* **Providing feedback:** AI can be used to provide feedback on writing. This can be helpful for writers to identify areas where their writing can be improved.
* **Editing:** AI can be used to edit writing. This can be helpful for writers to catch errors and to improve the overall quality of their writing.

The use of AI in writing is a positive development. AI can help writers to be more creative and to produce better work. It can also help to democratize the writing process by making it easier for people who do not have traditional writing skills to create content.

However, there is a "silly Hollywood myth" that is often used to justify the use of AI in writing. This myth is that writers are lazy and that they are using AI to take the easy way out. The article argues that this myth is false, and that writers are actually using AI to be more creative and to produce better work.

The article concludes by arguing that the use of AI in writing is a positive development. The article argues that AI can help writers to be more creative and to produce better work, and that it can also help to democratize the writing process.

**What do you think? Is the use of AI in writing a positive development?**
