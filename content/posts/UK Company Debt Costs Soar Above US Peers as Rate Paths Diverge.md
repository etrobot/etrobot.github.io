## UK Companies Face Higher Borrowing Costs

The cost of debt for UK companies has soared above their US peers as the paths of interest rate hikes diverge between the two countries.

The Bank of England is expected to raise rates four more times this year, while the Federal Reserve is seen pausing after its next two increases. This has led to a widening gap between yields on sterling- and dollar-denominated corporate bonds.

Investment-grade UK companies have seen yields rise almost 70 basis points this year, compared with a rise of just 12 basis points for their US counterparts. The higher borrowing costs are a further headwind for UK businesses, which are already facing rising inflation, labor shortages and supply chain disruptions.

The article also notes that the UK government is considering a number of measures to help businesses cope with the cost of living crisis, including a windfall tax on energy companies and a cut to fuel duty. However, it is unclear whether these measures will be enough to offset the rising cost of debt.

### What does this mean for businesses?

The rising cost of debt is likely to put pressure on UK businesses' profit margins and could lead to slower investment and job growth. Businesses that are heavily reliant on debt financing may be particularly vulnerable to the higher borrowing costs.

### What can businesses do to mitigate the impact of rising debt costs?

Businesses can take a number of steps to mitigate the impact of rising debt costs, such as:

* **Reducing their debt levels:** This can be done by paying down debt or refinancing at lower interest rates.
* **Improving their cash flow:** This can be done by increasing sales, reducing costs or both.
* **Hedging their interest rate risk:** This can be done by using financial instruments such as interest rate swaps.

The rising cost of debt is a challenge for UK businesses, but there are a number of steps that businesses can take to mitigate the impact.
