## Artificial Intelligence to be Key Focus of Singapore FinTech Festival

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has said that artificial intelligence (AI) will be a key focus of the upcoming Singapore FinTech Festival. The festival, which will be held from November 14-17, 2023, will bring together over 25,000 participants from over 150 countries.

MAS chief fintech officer Sopnendu Mohanty said that AI has the potential to transform the financial services industry, and that the festival will provide a platform for businesses and regulators to collaborate on developing and using AI-powered solutions.

Some of the areas where AI is expected to have a major impact on the financial services industry include:

* **Risk management:** AI can be used to develop more sophisticated models for assessing risk, which can help to reduce losses and improve the profitability of financial institutions.
* **Customer service:** AI can be used to automate tasks such as customer support and fraud detection, which can free up employees to focus on more complex and value-added activities.
* **Compliance:** AI can be used to identify and mitigate compliance risks, which can help to protect financial institutions from fines and penalties.

The Singapore FinTech Festival is one of the largest fintech events in the world, and it is a great opportunity for businesses and regulators to learn about the latest developments in AI and to collaborate on developing and using AI-powered solutions.

If you are interested in learning more about AI and its impact on the financial services industry, I encourage you to attend the Singapore FinTech Festival.
