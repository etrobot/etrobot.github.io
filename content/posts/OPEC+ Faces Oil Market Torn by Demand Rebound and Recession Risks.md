## OPEC+ Faces Oil Market Torn by Demand Rebound and Recession Risks

**OPEC+ is facing a difficult balancing act as the oil market is torn between demand rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic and recession risks.**

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned that the global oil market could be in a deficit of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in the third quarter of 2023, if Russian output falls by 3 million bpd. However, the IEA has also said that there is a risk of a recession in the United States and Europe, which could dampen demand for oil.

**OPEC+ is expected to stick to its current production plan at its next meeting on June 2, but it is possible that the group could be forced to act if the market tightens further.**

Overall, the article suggests that the oil market is facing a period of uncertainty, with both demand and supply factors likely to play a role in determining prices.

**Here are some of the key factors that could impact the oil market in the coming months:**

* The pace of the global economic recovery
* The impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on energy markets
* The actions of OPEC+
* The weather

**It is important to note that the oil market is a complex system, and it is difficult to predict with certainty how these factors will play out.** However, it is clear that the oil market is facing a period of uncertainty, and it is important to stay up-to-date on the latest developments.
