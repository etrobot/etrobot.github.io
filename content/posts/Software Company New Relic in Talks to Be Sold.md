According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, private-equity firms Francisco Partners and TPG are jointly bidding over $5 billion to acquire New Relic, a software company specializing in analytics and observability tools [^1^][^2^][^3^]. The article did not provide any further information about the potential acquisition.

New Relic, founded in 2008, provides a range of cloud-based software products that help businesses to monitor and analyze their software applications and infrastructure. The company's products include application performance monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, and synthetic monitoring. Their software is used by more than 50% of the Fortune 100 companies.

The potential acquisition by Francisco Partners and TPG would mark a significant milestone for New Relic. The company went public in 2014 and has since grown to a market capitalization of approximately $4.5 billion. A sale to the private-equity firms would take the company off the public markets and allow it to operate with more flexibility.

Neither New Relic nor the private-equity firms have commented on the potential acquisition. It is unclear whether other suitors may emerge or if the deal will go through.

In recent years, private-equity firms have been increasingly active in the technology sector, looking to acquire established companies with strong growth potential. If the acquisition of New Relic is completed, it would be one of the largest technology deals by private-equity firms this year.

### Conclusion

New Relic, a cloud-based software company specializing in analytics and observability tools, is reportedly in talks to be acquired by private-equity firms Francisco Partners and TPG for over $5 billion. The potential acquisition would take the company off the public markets and give it more flexibility to operate. The deal is still in the negotiation phase, and it is unclear whether it will go through or if other suitors may emerge.
