## Samsung Suspends Review of Bing as Default Search Engine

Samsung Electronics has suspended an internal review that contemplated changing its smartphones' default search engine from Google to Microsoft's Bing.

The review was reportedly sparked by a desire to diversify Samsung's smartphone software and consider new offerings. However, the review has now been suspended, and it is unclear if Samsung will ever make a switch to Bing.

Google is the world's most popular search engine, and it is likely that Samsung will continue to use it as its default search engine on its smartphones.

The decision by Samsung to suspend its review of Bing is a positive development for Google. It is a sign that Google's search engine is still the preferred choice for many smartphone users. It is also a sign that Google is still the dominant player in the search engine market.

However, it is important to note that the decision by Samsung is not a guarantee that Google will never be challenged by another search engine. Microsoft has been investing heavily in Bing in recent years, and it is possible that the company will make a more serious effort to compete with Google in the future.

Overall, the decision by Samsung to suspend its review of Bing is a positive development for Google. However, it is important to remember that Google is not immune to competition, and it will need to continue to innovate and improve its search engine in order to maintain its dominance in the market.
