The Czech central bank is less likely to raise interest rates in the near future, according to Vice Governor Marek Moravec. Moravec said that the bank's main focus is now on supporting economic growth, which has been hit by the war in Ukraine and rising inflation. The bank has raised interest rates five times since June 2021, taking the benchmark rate to 5.75%. Moravec said that the bank is likely to pause its hiking cycle in the coming months, but could raise rates again if inflation remains high.

"We are not ruling out a further rate hike, but we are not seeing a need for it right now," Moravec said. "We need to see how the economy develops in the coming months."

The Czech Republic is facing a number of challenges, including the war in Ukraine, rising inflation, and a slowdown in economic growth. The war in Ukraine has caused energy prices to rise, which has put upward pressure on inflation. The slowdown in economic growth is due to a number of factors, including the war in Ukraine and the tightening of monetary policy by central banks around the world.

The Czech central bank is likely to keep interest rates at 5.75% for the time being, but could raise rates again if inflation remains high.
