## UBS's Sweet Deal for Credit Suisse Is Looking Even Sweeter

UBS's acquisition of Credit Suisse is looking like a better deal for UBS as the value of Credit Suisse's assets has declined. UBS is expected to pay around $3.5 billion for Credit Suisse, which is a fraction of the $20 billion that Credit Suisse was worth just a few years ago.

The decline in Credit Suisse's asset value is due to a number of factors, including the collapse of Archegos Capital Management, the Swiss bank's exposure to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the ongoing turmoil in the global financial markets.

The acquisition of Credit Suisse will give UBS a larger market share in the global investment banking and wealth management businesses. UBS is also expected to benefit from Credit Suisse's strong presence in Asia.

The acquisition of Credit Suisse is a major coup for UBS and is likely to make it a more competitive player in the global financial markets.
