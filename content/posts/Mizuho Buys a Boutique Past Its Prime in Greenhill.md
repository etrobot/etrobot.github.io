**Mizuho Buys Greenhill & Co.**

Mizuho Financial Group Inc. is buying Greenhill & Co., a boutique investment bank that has fallen on hard times. The deal is valued at $2.2 billion, including debt.

The sale is a sign of the changing landscape in investment banking, as larger banks are increasingly consolidating and smaller firms are struggling to compete. Greenhill has been hit hard by the decline in mergers and acquisitions activity. The firm's revenue has fallen by more than half in the past five years. Greenhill's stock price has also fallen sharply, and it is now trading below its IPO price of $25 per share.

The sale to Mizuho is a lifeline for Greenhill, but it also marks the end of an era for the boutique investment bank.

**Here are some key takeaways from the deal:**

* Mizuho is buying Greenhill for its expertise in mergers and acquisitions advisory.
* The deal is a sign of the changing landscape in investment banking, as larger banks are increasingly consolidating and smaller firms are struggling to compete.
* The sale is likely to lead to layoffs at Greenhill.
* It is unclear how Greenhill's culture will change under Mizuho's ownership.
