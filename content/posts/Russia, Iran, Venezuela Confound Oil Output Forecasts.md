The International Energy Agency (IEA) has lifted its forecast for Russian, Iranian, and Venezuelan output in 2023 by a combined 1.3 million barrels a day, reaching an annual average of 14.3 million barrels a day, according to a recent article on Bloomberg [1]. 

This news comes as a surprise to some, as the three countries have confounded oil output forecasts. The article on Bloomberg suggests that the increase in production is due to a combination of factors, including improved technology, investment, and a desire to capitalize on higher oil prices. 

However, not everyone is convinced that this increase in supply will solve the current weakness in the oil market. As a recent article in The Washington Post points out [2], the real weakness in the market is not demand, but rather supply. Even with the increase in output from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela, there are still concerns about the ability of other major oil producers to meet demand. 

The situation in Russia and the impact of sanctions on the country's upstream and oilfield services market are also worth noting. According to a report on Yahoo Finance [3], the Russo-Ukraine war has had a significant impact on the market, and sanctions are expected to continue to affect the industry for years to come. 

In a related development, a CNN article from last year [4] highlighted how President Biden was turning to countries like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iran, and Russia, despite previous efforts to avoid them, in order to find solutions to the global oil price crisis. 

Overall, the increase in oil output from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela may provide some relief to the market, but it is unlikely to solve the underlying supply issues. The situation in Russia, in particular, is complex and will continue to be affected by both political and economic factors.
