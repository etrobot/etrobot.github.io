## Nigeria Central Bank Denies Devaluing Naira as Calls Grow Louder

The Nigerian Central Bank (CBN) has denied reports that it is planning to devalue the naira. The CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, said that the naira is "fundamentally strong" and that there is no need to devalue it.

However, there have been growing calls for the CBN to devalue the naira, as the country's foreign exchange reserves have fallen to a record low. A devaluation would make imports more expensive, but it would also make exports more competitive. The CBN is under pressure to balance the needs of exporters and importers, as well as the need to protect the value of people's savings.

The article also mentions that the CBN has taken a number of measures to try to stabilize the naira, including:

* Selling dollars to commercial banks
* Increasing the amount of foreign exchange available for imports
* Tightening restrictions on foreign exchange trading

It is unclear whether these measures will be enough to prevent a devaluation of the naira. The CBN is likely to continue to monitor the situation closely and make any necessary changes to its policy.

In the meantime, businesses and individuals in Nigeria should be prepared for the possibility of a devaluation. This could lead to higher prices for imports and could make it more difficult to get foreign exchange.

### What is a devaluation?

A devaluation is a reduction in the value of a currency relative to another currency. In the case of Nigeria, a devaluation of the naira would mean that it would take more naira to buy one US dollar.

### Why is the CBN under pressure to devalue the naira?

The CBN is under pressure to devalue the naira because the country's foreign exchange reserves have fallen to a record low. Foreign exchange reserves are the amount of foreign currency that a country has available to it. They are used to pay for imports, service debt, and stabilize the currency.

The fall in Nigeria's foreign exchange reserves is due to a number of factors, including:

* A decline in oil prices
* A slowdown in economic growth
* Increased demand for foreign exchange

### What are the implications of a devaluation?

A devaluation of the naira would have a number of implications for Nigeria, including:

* Higher prices for imports
* Lower prices for exports
* Increased inflation
* Reduced economic growth

### What can be done to prevent a devaluation?

There are a number of things that can be done to prevent a devaluation, including:

* Increasing oil prices
* Accelerating economic growth
* Reducing demand for foreign exchange

The CBN is likely to take a number of measures to try to prevent a devaluation, including:

* Selling more dollars to commercial banks
* Increasing the amount of foreign exchange available for imports
* Tightening restrictions on foreign exchange trading

It is unclear whether these measures will be enough to prevent a devaluation. The CBN is likely to continue to monitor the situation closely and make any necessary changes to its policy.

In the meantime, businesses and individuals in Nigeria should be prepared for the possibility of a devaluation. This could lead to higher prices for imports and could make it more difficult to get foreign exchange.
