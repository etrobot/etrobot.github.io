## Rally in Indian Property Stocks Seen Extending on Rates

Indian property stocks have rallied sharply in recent months, with the NSE Nifty Realty Index gaining more than 36% since March lows. The rally has been driven by a number of factors, including expectations that the central bank may start cutting interest rates next year.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept rates on hold for the past eight months, but there is growing expectation that it will start cutting rates in early 2023. Lower interest rates will make it cheaper for home buyers to borrow money, which could lead to increased demand for property. This could further boost the rally in Indian property stocks.

Here are some additional details from the article:

* The NSE Nifty Realty Index is now trading at its highest level since January 2022.
* The rally has been broad-based, with all major property stocks posting gains.
* The rally has been driven by both domestic and foreign investors.
* Domestic investors have been attracted by the low valuations of property stocks.

Overall, the rally in Indian property stocks is seen extending on expectations of lower interest rates. The rally could be further boosted by increased demand for property from both domestic and foreign investors.
