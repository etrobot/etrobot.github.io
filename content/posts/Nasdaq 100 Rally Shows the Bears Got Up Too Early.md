The Nasdaq 100 Index has been making headlines lately with its impressive performance this year, gaining 23% and edging close to a 52-week high. This has caused some to question the validity of earlier predictions of a bear market, and has led to discussions on the importance of timing in stock market predictions.

In an article titled "Nasdaq 100 Rally Shows the Bears Got Up Too Early" published in The Washington Post [1], the author, Jonathan Levin, argues that the Nasdaq 100's performance this year demonstrates why timing is just as important as being right. While the US stock market doomsayers may still be vindicated in the long run, the fact that the Nasdaq 100 has rebounded so strongly shows that being right too early can be just as detrimental as being wrong.

Similarly, an article by Bloomberg [2] highlights the same point, stating that the Nasdaq 100 rally shows why timing is crucial in the stock market. The article also suggests that this rally could be an indication that the market is not as overvalued as many had thought.

It's important to note that while the Nasdaq 100's performance this year may be impressive, it doesn't necessarily mean that the stock market is out of the woods. As an article on Nasdaq.com [3] points out, the "Santa Claus rally" may have contributed to the Nasdaq 100's recent gains, and it may be too early to credit the Grinch just yet.

Overall, the recent rally of the Nasdaq 100 Index has sparked discussions on the importance of timing in stock market predictions. While it's important to make accurate predictions, it's also important to consider when those predictions will come to fruition. As the saying goes, "timing is everything."
