Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles has said that US allies can have productive ties with China, even as they maintain a longstanding defense alliance with the US.

Marles said that navigating the two relationships is complex and requires discussion, but he believes it is possible to have both a productive relationship with China and a strong defense alliance with the US.

Marles' comments come at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions between the US and China. Australia is a longstanding security ally of the US and is seeking to mend economic ties with China, its largest trade partner, that soured during the pandemic.

In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Marles said that China's military buildup is a concern for Australia and other countries in the region. He said that China needs to provide more clarity about its intentions and goals with its military buildup.

Marles said that Australia is committed to working with China to address shared challenges, such as climate change and non-proliferation.

Overall, Marles' comments reflect Australia's desire to have a balanced relationship with China. Australia wants to maintain a strong defense alliance with the US, but it also wants to have productive economic ties with China. Marles believes that it is possible to achieve both of these goals, but it will require careful navigation.
