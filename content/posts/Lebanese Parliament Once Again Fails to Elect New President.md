Lebanon's parliament has failed to elect a new president for the 12th time, deepening the country's political crisis.

The failure to elect a president has left Lebanon without a fully empowered government since October 2022, when the previous cabinet resigned. The country has also been facing a severe economic crisis, with a fuel shortage and a looming food crisis.

The political impasse is a result of the deep divisions between Lebanon's various sectarian groups. The country's political system is based on a power-sharing agreement between Christians, Muslims, and Druze. However, this system has broken down in recent years, as different groups have become increasingly divided.

The situation in Lebanon is becoming increasingly desperate. The country's economy has shrunk by more than half since 2019, and the Lebanese pound has lost more than 90% of its value. Inflation is at an all-time high, and many people are struggling to afford food, medicine, and other basic necessities.

The failure to elect a president is a major setback for Lebanon. It is unclear how the country will be able to overcome its current crisis without a strong government.
