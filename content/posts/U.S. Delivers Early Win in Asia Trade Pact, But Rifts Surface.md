The U.S. and 13 other Asia-Pacific nations have agreed to expand supply-chain cooperation in a move aimed at strengthening economic ties in the region and countering China's growing influence.

The pact, which was announced at the Detroit Economic Club by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, includes provisions for cooperation on supply chain resilience, digital trade, and labor standards. It also includes a mechanism for dispute resolution.

The pact is seen as a major victory for the Biden administration, which has been under pressure to deliver on its promises to strengthen economic ties in the Indo-Pacific region. However, some trade officials have expressed concerns about the pact's focus on protecting domestic jobs and bolstering U.S. manufacturing. They worry that these policies could hurt smaller or less-wealthy nations that rely on trade to grow their economies.

The pact is still in its early stages, and it remains to be seen how effective it will be in achieving its goals. However, it is a significant step forward for the Biden administration's efforts to build a more resilient and inclusive global economy.
