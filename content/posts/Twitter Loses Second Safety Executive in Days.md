Twitter has lost two top safety executives in days, as A.J. Brown, head of brand safety and ad quality, is leaving the company. Brown's departure comes after Ella Irwin, Twitter's head of trust and safety, left on Thursday.

The departures come as concerns about Twitter's content moderation policies grow. Some advertisers have paused their spending on Twitter over concerns that their ads could appear alongside harmful content. Twitter is facing increasing pressure to improve its content moderation policies.

Twitter CEO Elon Musk has said that he wants to make Twitter a more free speech-friendly platform. However, this could lead to an increase in harmful content on the platform, which could further alienate advertisers.

It remains to be seen how Twitter will address the concerns about its content moderation policies. However, the departures of Brown and Irwin are a sign that the company is facing a serious challenge.
