## The New Rules for Business Travel to China

Business travel to China can be a challenge, but it can also be a rewarding experience. By following these tips, you can increase your chances of success:

* **Be prepared for heightened security measures.** Chinese border agents are increasingly scrutinizing travelers, especially those from the United States. Be prepared to answer questions about your travel plans, your business in China, and your personal life.
* **Be aware of the political climate.** The relationship between the United States and China is currently strained. Be careful about what you say and do in China, as you could be seen as a spy or a threat to national security.
* **Use a burner phone.** A burner phone is a disposable phone that you can use while in China. This will help to protect your privacy and prevent the Chinese government from tracking your communications.
* **Be careful what you post on social media.** The Chinese government closely monitors social media. Be careful about what you post on social media while in China, as you could be detained or deported for criticizing the government or its policies.
* **Have a backup plan.** If you are detained by the Chinese government, have a backup plan in place. This could include contacting your embassy or consulate, hiring a lawyer, or reaching out to a human rights organization.
