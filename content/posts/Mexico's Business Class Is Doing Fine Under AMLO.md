**Mexico's Business Class Thrives Under AMLO**

The Mexican business class has largely thrived under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO). The stock market has reached record highs, and foreign investment has increased. AMLO has also implemented a number of policies that have been beneficial to businesses, such as reducing taxes and regulations.

However, there are some concerns that AMLO's policies could ultimately hurt the business class in the long run. For example, AMLO has proposed increasing taxes on businesses and raising the minimum wage. These policies could make it more difficult for businesses to operate and could lead to job losses.

Overall, the Mexican business class is doing well under AMLO, but there are some concerns about the future.
