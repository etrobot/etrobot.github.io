According to a recent article on Moneycontrol, the green hydrogen trade will not have a dominant country because hydrogen will be used close to where it is produced. This means that countries rich in cheap renewables, such as Australia, Brazil, and Chile, hope to become hydrogen hubs. Even Saudi Arabia, traditionally known for its oil production, is investing $8.5 billion in a green hydrogen plant.

This vision of a dispersed green hydrogen market may come as a surprise to those who expected a new iteration of the OPEC cartel in the renewable energy era. However, the decentralized nature of renewable energy production and the high cost of transporting hydrogen make a centralized market unlikely. 

Green hydrogen is produced by using renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. It has been hailed as a key component of the transition to a low-carbon future, as it can be used as a fuel for transportation, heating and industrial processes without producing greenhouse gas emissions. 

Australia, in particular, has been positioning itself as a major player in the green hydrogen market. The country has abundant wind and solar resources, and its government has committed to investing in green hydrogen infrastructure. Billionaire entrepreneur Andrew Forrest, the founder of Fortescue Metals Group, has also been a vocal proponent of green hydrogen and has called on the Australian government to invest more in the industry. 

Chile and Brazil are also well-positioned to become green hydrogen hubs. Chile is home to some of the world's largest copper mines, which could use green hydrogen to power their operations. Brazil has a large agricultural sector that could benefit from using green hydrogen for fertilizer production.

While there may not be a dominant country in the green hydrogen market, there are still challenges to be overcome. The production of green hydrogen is currently more expensive than producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, and the infrastructure to transport and store hydrogen is not yet developed. However, as the technology improves and more countries invest in green hydrogen, it is likely that the market will continue to grow and become more competitive.

In conclusion, the green hydrogen age is an exciting new chapter in the transition to a low-carbon future. While no country is expected to dominate the market, countries with abundant renewable resources, such as Australia, Chile, and Brazil, are well-positioned to become key players. As the market grows and technology improves, it is likely that green hydrogen will become an increasingly important part of the global energy mix.
