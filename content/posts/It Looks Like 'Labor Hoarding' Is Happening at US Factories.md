## Labor Shortage in Manufacturing

The US manufacturing sector is facing a labor shortage, which is forcing some factories to hoard workers. Labor hoarding is when a company keeps more workers on staff than it needs, in case of unexpected turnover or increased demand.

The labor shortage is being driven by a number of factors, including the retirement of baby boomers, the decline of manufacturing jobs in the US, and the increasing automation of manufacturing processes.

The labor shortage is having a number of negative consequences for the manufacturing sector, including lower productivity, higher costs, and delays in production.

The government and businesses are taking steps to address the labor shortage, but it is unclear how long it will take to resolve the issue.
