# Serbia Surprises With Rate Hike After Hitting Pause Last Month

Serbia's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 3.9 percent on Wednesday, surprising analysts who had expected the bank to hold rates steady.

The hike was the first since December and comes as Serbia grapples with rising inflation, which hit a 10-year high of 10.3 percent in April.

The central bank said the hike was necessary to "contain inflation pressures and anchor inflation expectations."

The bank also said it expects inflation to remain elevated in the coming months, but that it should start to decline in the second half of the year.

The article also mentions that the central bank has raised rates 10 times since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in an effort to control inflation. However, inflation has continued to rise, due in part to rising energy and food prices. The central bank is likely to continue to raise rates in an effort to bring inflation under control.
