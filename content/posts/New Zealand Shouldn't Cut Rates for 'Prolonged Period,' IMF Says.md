## IMF Advises New Zealand's Central Bank to Keep Interest Rates High

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has advised New Zealand's central bank, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), not to cut interest rates for a "prolonged period".

The IMF said in a report released on Wednesday that the RBNZ has "appropriately" raised interest rates by 1.25 percentage points since October 2021. The IMF said that the RBNZ's actions are helping to slow consumer-price gains, which are currently running at a 30-year high.

However, the IMF warned that if inflation persists, the RBNZ may need to raise rates further. The IMF said that the RBNZ should "remain open to further tightening of monetary policy" if inflation does not fall back to its target band of 1-3%.

The IMF also said that New Zealand's economy is "doing well" and that there is no need for the RBNZ to cut rates to stimulate growth. The IMF said that New Zealand's unemployment rate is low and that economic growth is expected to remain strong in the near term.

The IMF's advice is likely to be welcomed by the RBNZ, which has been under pressure from some quarters to cut interest rates to help businesses and consumers. However, the IMF's warning that the RBNZ may need to raise rates further suggests that the central bank is likely to remain cautious in its monetary policy stance.

### What does this mean for New Zealand?

The IMF's advice means that New Zealanders can expect to continue to pay higher interest rates for the foreseeable future. This could have a number of implications for businesses and consumers, including:

* Higher mortgage payments
* Higher credit card interest rates
* Higher car loan interest rates
* Higher business loan interest rates

The higher interest rates could also slow the pace of economic growth in New Zealand. However, the IMF is confident that New Zealand's economy is strong enough to withstand the higher interest rates.

### What can New Zealanders do?

New Zealanders can prepare for higher interest rates by:

* Making sure they have a solid financial plan in place
* Reviewing their debt repayments
* Starting to save more money

New Zealanders should also be aware of the impact that higher interest rates could have on their businesses and investments.
