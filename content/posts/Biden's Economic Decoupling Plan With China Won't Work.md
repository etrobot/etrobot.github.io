## Introduction 

The economic relationship between the United States and China has been fraught with tension for some time now, with both countries imposing tariffs and other trade restrictions on each other. Recently, President Biden's administration has taken steps towards what they call "economic decoupling" with China, a policy aimed at reducing the US's dependence on China's economy. However, recent articles suggest that this approach may not be successful. In this blog post, we review a few recent articles on the topic to gain a better understanding of the arguments for and against Biden's economic decoupling plan. 

## Article 1: Washington Post 

The first article we look at is from the Washington Post[^1^]. The article suggests that while the Biden-Xi meeting could slow the fraying economic and trade relationship between the US and China, it is unlikely to stop it. The article argues that the US and China are too intertwined economically, and that a precise, limited decoupling is unlikely to work. 

## Article 2: Global Times 

The second article we look at is from the Global Times[^2^]. The article criticizes Biden's escalation of economic decoupling over Xinjiang and Hong Kong, arguing that it is a shortsighted approach that will ultimately harm US interests. The article suggests that economic cooperation between the US and China is necessary for mutual prosperity. 

## Article 3: Global Times 

The third article we look at is also from the Global Times[^3^]. The article argues that Washington's push for "decoupling" won't stop US companies from investing in China. The article cites examples of US companies that continue to invest in China despite political tensions. 

## Article 4: Bloomberg 

The fourth article we look at is from Bloomberg[^4^]. The article argues that Biden's economic decoupling plan with China won't work. The author suggests that while Biden's team envisions a precise, limited decoupling that protects US interests and values in key areas, this approach is unlikely to work because it is too difficult to separate the US and Chinese economies. 

## Article 5: Politico 

The fifth article we look at is from Politico[^5^]. The article suggests that Biden has reversed decades of Chinese trade policy, marking a "sea change" in US-China relations. The article suggests that Biden's approach may be successful in reducing US dependence on China's economy, but that it also carries risks for both countries. 

## Article 6: Washington Post 

The final article we look at is also from the Washington Post[^6^]. The article argues that economic talks with China won't repair the relationship between the US and China. The article suggests that while economic talks may be necessary, they are unlikely to address the broader geopolitical tensions between the two countries. 

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, recent articles suggest that Biden's economic decoupling plan with China may not be successful. While some argue that economic cooperation between the US and China is necessary for mutual prosperity, others suggest that the US and Chinese economies are too intertwined to separate. Ultimately, it remains to be seen whether Biden's approach will be successful in reducing US dependence on China's economy or whether it will lead to further tensions between the two countries.
