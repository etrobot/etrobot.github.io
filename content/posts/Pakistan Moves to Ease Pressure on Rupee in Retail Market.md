Pakistan has taken a number of steps to stabilize the rupee in the retail market. These measures include increasing the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) foreign exchange reserves by $1 billion, selling dollars to commercial banks at a discounted rate, and increasing the amount of foreign currency that Pakistanis can carry when they travel abroad.

The government's measures have had some success in stabilizing the rupee, but it is too early to say whether they will be enough to prevent a further depreciation. The article also mentions that the Pakistani government is facing a number of challenges, including a widening trade deficit, a high budget deficit, and a slowdown in economic growth. These challenges are putting pressure on the rupee and making it difficult for the government to stabilize the currency.

The article concludes by saying that the Pakistani government needs to take further steps to address the underlying causes of the rupee's weakness. These steps could include reducing the trade deficit, reducing the budget deficit, and increasing economic growth. The government's ability to address these challenges will determine whether the rupee can be stabilized in the long term.
