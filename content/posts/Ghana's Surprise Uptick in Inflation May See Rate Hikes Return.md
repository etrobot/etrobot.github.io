Ghana's inflation rate rose to 27.6% in May, from 23.6% in April, the highest level in 28 years. The surprise uptick in inflation was driven by rising food and energy prices.

The Bank of Ghana is likely to raise interest rates again in an effort to curb inflation. The rate hike could slow economic growth, but it is seen as necessary to bring inflation under control.

The rise in inflation is a major challenge for the government of Ghana. The government has already taken some steps to address the issue, including releasing $1 billion from the country's foreign exchange reserves to stabilize the cedi, the national currency.

However, more needs to be done to address the underlying causes of inflation, such as high food and energy prices. The rate hike is seen as a necessary step to curb inflation, but it could have a negative impact on economic growth.

The government will need to carefully balance the need to control inflation with the need to support economic growth.
