## Uyghur Scholar Missing in Hong Kong

A Uyghur scholar, Abuduwaili Abudureheman, has been missing in Hong Kong since May 10, 2023. Abudureheman was last heard from saying he was being interrogated by police. Amnesty International has raised concerns that Abudureheman may have been detained by the Chinese government. The Chinese government has denied any involvement in Abudureheman's disappearance. Abudureheman's disappearance has raised concerns about the safety of Uyghurs in Hong Kong.

**Key Points**

* Abudureheman is a Uyghur scholar who had been living in Hong Kong for several years.
* He was last seen on May 10, 2023, when he went to meet a friend in Hong Kong.
* Abudureheman has not been seen or heard from since.
* Amnesty International has raised concerns that Abudureheman may have been detained by the Chinese government.
* The Chinese government has denied any involvement in Abudureheman's disappearance.
* Abudureheman's disappearance has raised concerns about the safety of Uyghurs in Hong Kong.

**Background**

The Chinese government has a long history of persecuting Uyghurs, a Muslim minority group in China. In recent years, the Chinese government has cracked down on Uyghurs in Xinjiang, a region in western China where most Uyghurs live. The crackdown has included mass detentions, forced labor, and cultural suppression.

**Concerns**

The disappearance of Abudureheman is a reminder of the risks that Uyghurs face in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is supposed to be a special administrative region of China with a high degree of autonomy. However, the Chinese government has been increasingly exerting its control over Hong Kong in recent years. This has raised concerns about the future of Hong Kong's autonomy and the rights of its residents.

**Call to Action**

The disappearance of Abudureheman is a serious concern. It is important to hold the Chinese government accountable for its actions and to ensure the safety of Uyghurs in Hong Kong. You can help by:

* Contacting your elected representatives and urging them to take action on the issue of Uyghur persecution.
* Raising awareness of the issue of Uyghur persecution through social media and other channels.
* Supporting organizations that are working to help Uyghurs.

Together, we can make a difference.
