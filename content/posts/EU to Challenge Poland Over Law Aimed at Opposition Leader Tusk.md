The European Commission has challenged Poland at the European Court of Justice over a new law that could be used to target opposition leader Donald Tusk.

The law, which was passed by the Polish parliament last week, gives the government the power to strip former prime ministers of their immunity from prosecution. Tusk, who served as prime minister of Poland from 2007 to 2014, is currently the president of the European Council.

The Commission has said that the law is "incompatible with the rule of law" and that it "seriously undermines the independence of the judiciary." The Commission has asked the Polish government to suspend the law until the case is resolved by the Court of Justice.

The Polish government has defended the law, saying that it is necessary to ensure that former prime ministers are held accountable for their actions. However, the Commission has said that the law is "disproportionate" and that it could be used to target political opponents.

The case is likely to be closely watched by other European countries, as it raises important questions about the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.
