**Suspicious Package Halts Japan Court Proceedings for Abe Killing**

Proceedings on the fatal shooting case of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe were temporarily halted after a suspicious package was delivered to the Nara District Court premises.

The suspect, Tetsuya Yamagami, had been due in court for pretrial consultations when the incident occurred. Staff and visitors to the building were briefly evacuated as police dealt with the potentially dangerous object.

The package was later determined to be harmless, but the incident caused a security scare and delayed the court proceedings.

The article also provides some background information on the case, including the fact that Yamagami has confessed to shooting Abe and has been charged with murder. The trial is scheduled to begin in July.

**Background**

Shinzo Abe was assassinated on July 8, 2022, while giving a campaign speech in Nara, Japan. He was shot twice from behind by Tetsuya Yamagami, a former member of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. Abe was rushed to the hospital but died of his injuries.

Yamagami has confessed to shooting Abe and has been charged with murder. He has told police that he was motivated by Abe's political views.

**Trial**

The trial of Tetsuya Yamagami is scheduled to begin on July 18, 2023. He faces a maximum sentence of death if convicted.
