The UK housing market is showing signs of slowing down, with house prices stabilizing in May after a sharp rise in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, transaction volumes are falling, suggesting that further price falls are only a matter of time.

This is due to a number of factors, including rising interest rates and the cost of living crisis. The Nationwide Building Society, which has been tracking house prices for over 100 years, said that prices rose by 0.3% in May, the smallest monthly increase since November 2021. However, the average house price in the UK is still £272,992, which is 10.4% higher than a year ago.

The fall in transaction volumes is more pronounced, with the number of homes sold falling by 16.6% in May compared to the same month last year. This is likely due to a number of factors, including rising interest rates, the cost of living crisis, and uncertainty about the future of the UK economy.

The article concludes by saying that the UK housing market is likely to remain volatile in the near future. The government has announced a number of measures to help people with the cost of living, including a £400 energy bill discount and a £150 council tax rebate. However, it is too early to say whether these measures will be enough to prevent a significant fall in house prices.
