## UK House Prices Drop

House prices in the UK have fallen for the first time in three months, as buyers are stretched by rising interest rates and the cost of living.

The average price of a home in the UK fell by 0.3% in May, according to data from Nationwide. This is the first time that house prices have fallen since February, and it suggests that the housing market is starting to cool.

Analysts say that more declines are possible, as the cost of living continues to rise and interest rates are expected to go up further. The government's Help to Buy scheme, which has been credited with boosting the housing market, is due to end in March 2023. This could also lead to further declines in house prices, as it will make it more difficult for first-time buyers to afford a home.

Overall, the article suggests that the UK housing market is starting to cool, as buyers are stretched by rising interest rates and the cost of living. More declines are possible in the coming months, as the cost of living continues to rise and interest rates are expected to go up further.
