## Eviction Moratoriums Expire: What You Need to Know

Eviction moratoriums have been a lifeline for many people who have fallen behind on rent during the pandemic. However, as these moratoriums expire, advocates warn that there could be a wave of evictions that could push more people into homelessness.

Here are some things you need to know about eviction moratoriums and what you can do to protect yourself:

* Eviction moratoriums are laws that prevent landlords from evicting tenants who are behind on rent.
* The eviction moratoriums that were put in place in March 2020 have expired in most states.
* In some cities and states, there are still eviction moratoriums in place, but they are set to expire soon.
* If you are behind on rent, you should contact your landlord as soon as possible to discuss your options.
* There are a number of programs that can help you pay your rent, including rental assistance programs and government-funded eviction diversion programs.
* If you are facing eviction, you should speak with an attorney to discuss your legal rights.

The eviction crisis is a complex issue with no easy solutions. However, it is important to take steps to prevent a wave of evictions that could push more people into homelessness.
