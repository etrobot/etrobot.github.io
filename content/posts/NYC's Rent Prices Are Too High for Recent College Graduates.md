## NYC's Rent Prices Are Too High for Recent College Graduates

Rental prices in New York City are growing at nearly twice the rate of entry-level salaries. This means that recent college graduates are finding it increasingly difficult to afford to live in the city on their own.

In order to make ends meet, many young people are taking on multiple jobs, sharing apartments with roommates, or relying on financial assistance from their parents. The high cost of rent is a major barrier to young people who want to live and work in New York City.

The article also includes a few stories of recent college graduates who are struggling to afford rent in the city. One young woman, Macy Hung, works two jobs and shares a penthouse apartment with four roommates in order to afford her rent. Another young man, John Smith, moved back in with his parents after graduating from college because he couldn't afford to live on his own in the city.

The high cost of rent in New York City is a serious problem for young people. It is making it difficult for them to live and work in the city, and it is forcing them to make difficult choices about their finances.

### What can be done to help?

There are a few things that can be done to help young people afford to live in New York City. One is to increase the supply of affordable housing. Another is to provide financial assistance to young people who are struggling to pay rent. Finally, employers can offer higher salaries to entry-level employees.

By taking these steps, we can help make New York City a more affordable place for young people to live and work.
