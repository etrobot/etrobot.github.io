## Economic Activity Slowing Down?

A new article from the KPMG Supply Chain Institute suggests that there are signs that economic activity is slowing down. The article cites several data points, including:

* Paper mills are operating at about 70% capacity, which is down from 90% to 92% capacity when the economy is running smoothly.
* Inventory levels have also gone down, and respondents to a survey anticipate that inventory levels will contract over the next year, leading to a continuing slide in transportation prices.
* The KPMG Supply Chain Stability Index, which is produced with the Association for Supply Chain Management, is at a low level.

These trends suggest that economic activity is slowing down. It is important to note that these are just indicators, and the economy could still continue to grow. However, it is worth paying attention to these trends and monitoring the situation closely.

### What does this mean for businesses?

Businesses should be aware of the potential slowdown in economic activity and take steps to mitigate the risks. This could include:

* Reviewing their supply chains to identify any potential bottlenecks or disruptions.
* Building up inventory to ensure they have enough stock on hand to meet demand.
* Working with suppliers to negotiate better prices.
* Developing contingency plans in case of a slowdown.

By taking these steps, businesses can help to protect themselves from the impact of a slowdown in economic activity.
