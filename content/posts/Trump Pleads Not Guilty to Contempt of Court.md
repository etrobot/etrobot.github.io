## Trump Pleads Not Guilty to Contempt of Court

Former President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of contempt of court for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

The charges stem from Trump's refusal to turn over documents and testify to the committee. Trump is the first former president to be charged with contempt of Congress. The charges carry a maximum penalty of one year in prison.

Trump's lawyers have argued that he is immune from prosecution while he is out of office. A trial is scheduled to begin on July 12.

The committee's investigation is ongoing, and it is possible that Trump could face additional charges. The case could have implications for future presidents, as it could set a precedent for how they can be held accountable for their actions while in office. The case is also likely to be a major focus of the 2022 midterm elections, as Democrats are hoping to use it to energize their base and win back control of Congress.

### What does this mean for the future of American democracy?

The charges against Trump are a significant development in the ongoing investigation into the January 6th attack. If Trump is convicted, it would be a major blow to his political career and could set a precedent for how future presidents are held accountable for their actions. The case is also likely to have a significant impact on American democracy, as it raises questions about the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of government.

### What can you do to help?

There are a number of things you can do to help hold Trump accountable for his actions. You can contact your elected representatives and urge them to support the House select committee's investigation. You can also donate to organizations that are working to protect American democracy. And you can stay informed about the latest developments in the case and share your knowledge with others.
