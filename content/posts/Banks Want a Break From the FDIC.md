In the wake of the recent regional banking crisis, banks are seeking relief from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), according to an article by Bloomberg [^1^][4]. The crisis has put a spotlight on the FDIC, which has been forced to rescue failed banks at a high cost. 

Banks bought a large amount of Treasury bonds and other US government-backed securities when interest rates were low, paying nearly 100 cents on the dollar for them. However, as interest rates have risen, the value of those bonds has decreased significantly, causing banks to suffer losses. 

As a result, banks are requesting a break from the FDIC to help alleviate their financial losses. This has raised questions about the role of the FDIC in protecting banks and depositors. 

The FDIC was created in 1933 to protect depositors and ensure the stability of the US banking system. It does this by providing insurance on deposits up to a certain amount. As of 2021, that amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank. 

If a bank fails, the FDIC steps in to pay depositors up to the insured amount. The FDIC will then take over the failed bank's assets and liabilities, and either sell them to another bank or liquidate them. 

While the FDIC has been successful in protecting depositors and stabilizing the banking system, the recent crisis has highlighted some of its limitations. The cost of rescuing failed banks has put a strain on the agency's resources and raised concerns about the potential for moral hazard. 

Banks are now asking for a break from the FDIC to help ease their losses from the recent crisis. This has led to debates about the role of the FDIC in protecting banks and depositors, and whether the agency should be reformed or abolished altogether. 

In conclusion, the recent regional banking crisis has put a spotlight on the role of the FDIC in protecting banks and depositors. While the agency has been successful in the past, the cost of rescuing failed banks has raised concerns about its effectiveness and potential for moral hazard. It remains to be seen whether banks will get the relief they are seeking from the FDIC, and what the future holds for the agency and the US banking system.
