## UK House Prices Fall for First Time in a Decade

House prices in the UK fell by 0.3% in May, marking the first annual drop since 2012. The fall in house prices was driven by a slowdown in the market, as buyers became more cautious in the face of rising interest rates and the cost of living crisis.

The Halifax index of house prices is now 0.3% lower than it was a year ago, and it is 1.5% lower than it was in February. The fall in house prices is likely to continue in the coming months, as the Bank of England raises interest rates further in an effort to control inflation.

The fall in house prices is good news for first-time buyers, who are now more likely to be able to afford a home. However, it is bad news for homeowners, who are likely to see the value of their homes fall.

The fall in house prices is a sign of the times. The UK economy is facing a number of challenges, including rising inflation, rising interest rates, and the cost of living crisis. These challenges are making it more difficult for people to afford homes.

It remains to be seen how long the fall in house prices will last. However, it is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
