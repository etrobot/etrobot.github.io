The debt ceiling is a self-imposed limit on the amount of money the US government can borrow. It has been raised 78 times since 1960, most recently in 2019. The current debt ceiling debate is a farce because it is clear that the US government will never default on its debt. The government has a long history of raising the debt ceiling whenever it is reached, and there is no reason to believe that this time will be any different.

The real problem is that US fiscal policy is a fiasco. The US government is spending more money than it is taking in, and this is unsustainable. The government's budget deficit is projected to reach $1 trillion in 2023.

The US government needs to adopt a more responsible fiscal policy in order to avoid economic disaster. This means cutting spending and raising taxes. It also means making long-term reforms to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare.

The debt ceiling debate is a symptom of a much larger problem: the US government's fiscal irresponsibility. The government needs to get its spending under control and start living within its means. If it doesn't, the consequences could be disastrous.
