## Montana Bans TikTok, Setting Off First Amendment Legal Battle

Montana became the first state in the U.S. to ban TikTok when Governor Greg Gianforte signed a bill into law on Wednesday afternoon. The law prohibits anyone in the state from downloading or using the app, and also applies to app stores that offer TikTok for download. TikTok has said it will challenge the ban in court, arguing that it violates the First Amendment. The ban is likely to set off a legal battle that could have implications for the future of TikTok in the U.S., as well as for the future of social media regulation in general.
