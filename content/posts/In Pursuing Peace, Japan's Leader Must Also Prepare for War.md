### Introduction

The G-7 meeting in Hiroshima has brought attention to Japan's leader, Fumio Kishida, and his pursuit of peace while also preparing for war. In a recent article published on Bloomberg, the author discusses the delicate balance that Kishida must strike in order to achieve his life's goal of nuclear disarmament while also moving Japan closer to being the world's largest nuclear power.

### The Article

The article titled "In Pursuing Peace, Japanâ€™s Leader Must Also Prepare for War" highlights the importance of Kishida's role in the G-7 summit. The choice of Hiroshima as the location for the summit has a certain poetry, as it was the site of the first nuclear attack in history. Kishida's pursuit of nuclear disarmament is a noble goal, but it comes with its own set of challenges.

The article goes on to discuss how Kishida must balance Japan's desire for peace and security with the need to maintain a strong military. While many may view Japan's military as a defensive force, the reality is that Japan is rapidly becoming one of the world's largest nuclear powers. This shift in power has raised concerns among Japan's neighbors, particularly China and North Korea.

Kishida's challenge is not an easy one. He must navigate the delicate balance between pursuing peace and preparing for war. He must find a way to reduce Japan's dependence on nuclear weapons while also maintaining a strong military presence. This is no easy task, but it is one that Kishida is uniquely suited to handle.

### Conclusion

The G-7 meeting in Hiroshima has brought attention to Japan's leader and his pursuit of peace while also preparing for war. Kishida must navigate the delicate balance between pursuing nuclear disarmament and maintaining a strong military presence. This is a challenge that is not to be taken lightly, but Kishida is the right person for the job.
