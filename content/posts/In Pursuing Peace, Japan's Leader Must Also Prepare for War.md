On May 16th, 2023, The Washington Post published an article titled "In Pursuing Peace, Japan's Leader Must Also Prepare for War" by an unknown author[^1^][1]. The article talks about how Fumio Kishida, Japan's leader, is working towards nuclear disarmament while simultaneously moving the nation closer to being the world's largest nuclear power. 

The article also mentions that the G-7 meeting is taking place in Hiroshima, the first city to suffer an atomic bombing[^1^][1]. This meeting is significant as it brings together the leaders of the seven largest advanced economies in the world to discuss issues such as global economic governance, climate change, and international security. 

The author argues that Japan's pursuit of peace should not come at the cost of neglecting its military capabilities. The article highlights how Japan's increasing military spending and focus on developing advanced military technology can be seen as a response to the increasingly assertive foreign policy of its neighbors, especially China and North Korea. 

In conclusion, the article emphasizes the need for Japan's leader to strike a balance between pursuing peace and preparing for war. While the pursuit of peace is a noble goal, it should not come at the expense of neglecting national defense.
