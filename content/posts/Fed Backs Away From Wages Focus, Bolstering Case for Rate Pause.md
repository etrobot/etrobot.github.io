## Fed Backs Away From Wages Focus, Bolstering Case for Rate Pause

The Federal Reserve is backing away from its focus on wage growth as a guide for monetary policy, a shift that could bolster the case for a pause in interest rate hikes later this year.

In a policy statement released Wednesday, the Fed said it would "continue to monitor inflation developments closely" but that it now expects "wage growth to remain subdued in the near term."

The Fed's shift in focus comes as inflation has remained below its 2% target for several months. The central bank has raised interest rates four times since December, but it is now signaling that it may be willing to pause its tightening cycle if inflation does not pick up.

The Fed's decision to back away from its focus on wages is a sign that it is becoming more concerned about the risks to the economy from rising interest rates. The central bank is trying to strike a delicate balance between raising rates enough to keep inflation in check without raising them so much that they slow economic growth.

**Here are some key takeaways from the article:**
