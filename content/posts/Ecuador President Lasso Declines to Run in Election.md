Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso has announced that he will not seek re-election in 2025. Lasso, who is a conservative economist, made the announcement in a video address to the nation on Tuesday. He said that he made the decision after careful consideration and that he is confident that Ecuador is on the right track.

Lasso's decision is a surprise to many, as he had been considered a frontrunner for re-election. However, his popularity has declined in recent months amid rising inflation and protests against his government. Lasso's decision leaves the 2025 election wide open. Several potential candidates have already announced their intention to run, including former President Rafael Correa and former Vice President Lenin Moreno.

Lasso was elected president in 2021 after defeating Correa's handpicked candidate, Andr√©s Arauz. Lasso's victory was seen as a repudiation of Correa's socialist policies. However, Lasso has struggled to govern in the face of rising inflation and protests against his government. His approval rating has fallen to around 20%.

Lasso's decision not to run in 2025 is a major setback for the conservative movement in Ecuador. It remains to be seen who will emerge as the frontrunner in the 2025 election.
