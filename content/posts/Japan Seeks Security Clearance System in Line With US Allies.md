## Japan Seeks Security Clearance System in Line With US Allies

The Japanese government plans to set up an official security clearance system for accessing classified information related to economic security. The system is intended to help Japanese companies win contracts abroad, particularly in areas such as cutting-edge chip technology and cyber security. The system will be modeled on those used by Japan's allies, such as the United States. The Japanese government hopes to have the system in place by next year's parliamentary session.

The article also quotes Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi, who said that the system is "essential" for Japan to maintain its economic security. She also called for increased chip production in Japan, saying that it is "a matter of national security."

The article concludes by saying that the new security clearance system is a sign of Japan's growing economic ambitions. It is also a sign of the country's increasing cooperation with its allies in the face of growing security threats.
