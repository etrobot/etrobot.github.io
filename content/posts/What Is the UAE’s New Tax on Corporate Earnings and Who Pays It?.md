## UAE Introduces New Corporate Tax

The UAE has introduced a new corporate tax of 9%, effective from June 1, 2023. The tax will be applied to all businesses that generate more than AED 1 million in annual turnover. Businesses that are located in free zones will be exempt from the tax.

The tax is expected to raise AED 20 billion for the UAE government. The government has said that the tax will be used to fund social programs and infrastructure projects.

The impact of the new tax on businesses in the UAE is still unknown. Some businesses are concerned that the tax will make them less competitive, while others believe that it will be a positive development for the economy.

* Increased costs: Businesses will need to factor in the cost of the new tax when setting their prices. This could lead to higher prices for consumers.
* Reduced profits: The new tax will reduce the amount of profit that businesses make. This could lead to job losses or reduced investment.
* Increased compliance costs: Businesses will need to comply with new reporting and filing requirements. This could add to their administrative burden.

**How can businesses prepare for the new tax?**

There are a number of things that businesses can do to prepare for the new tax. These include:

* Review their pricing: Businesses should review their pricing to ensure that they are taking into account the cost of the new tax.
* Review their operations: Businesses should review their operations to identify areas where they can reduce costs.
