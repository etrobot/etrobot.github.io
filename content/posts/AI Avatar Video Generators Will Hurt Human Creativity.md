# AI Avatar Video Generators: Potential Risks and Benefits

AI avatar video generators are a new technology that can create realistic videos of people that don't actually exist. These generators could be used for a variety of purposes, such as creating fake news videos or generating deepfakes.

There is a concern that these generators could have a negative impact on human creativity.

Another concern is that AI generators could be used to create content that is harmful or offensive.

The article concludes by calling for a discussion about the potential risks and benefits of AI avatar video generators.
