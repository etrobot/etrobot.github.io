## Brexit Hurts UK Investment Appeal, Hasn't Reduced Tax or Regulation

A new study by the Centre for European Reform (CER) found that Brexit has hurt the UK's investment appeal, with foreign direct investment (FDI) falling by 25% in the two years since the UK left the European Union.

The study also found that Brexit has not led to a reduction in taxes or regulation in the UK, as some proponents of Brexit had promised. In fact, the CER found that the UK's tax burden has increased since Brexit, and that regulation has become more complex.

The study's findings are likely to add to the pressure on the UK government to renegotiate its trade deal with the EU, which is currently being held up by disagreements over the Northern Ireland Protocol.

The article also includes comments from economists and business leaders about the impact of Brexit on the UK economy.

* Howard Archer, chief economist at EY Item Club, said that the CER's findings "are a further blow to the UK economy and highlight the damage that Brexit has done to the country's investment appeal."
* Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said that the CER's findings "are a reminder that Brexit is not yet done and dusted. We need to get the Northern Ireland Protocol sorted out and we need to make sure that the UK is open for business."

Overall, the article suggests that Brexit has had a negative impact on the UK's economy, and that the government needs to take steps to mitigate the damage.
