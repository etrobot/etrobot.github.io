## Spar Retailers Spend $35 Million on Diesel to Run Generators

South African food and liquor retailer Spar Group estimates that its outlets spent more than 700 million rand ($35 million) on diesel to run generators in the six months through March. This is more than triple the amount spent on diesel in the same period last year.

The increase in diesel costs is due to the country's ongoing power outages, which have forced businesses to rely on generators to stay open. Spar's retailers have also experienced higher repairs and maintenance costs, as well as product wastage, as generators occasionally fail under extended periods of usage.

The increased costs have had a direct impact on the retailers' trading performance and profitability.

The article also notes that Spar is not the only business that has been affected by the power outages. A growing number of businesses in South Africa are being forced to produce their own electricity, as the country's state-owned power utility, Eskom, struggles to meet demand.

The power outages are a major problem for South Africa's economy. They have led to job losses, reduced productivity, and increased costs for businesses. The government has been working to address the problem, but it is a complex issue that will take time to resolve.
