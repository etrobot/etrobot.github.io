## AI Regulation: OpenAI's Sam Altman Is the Wrong Person to Ask

In a recent article, Bloomberg argued that Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, is not the right person to ask about AI regulation. The article cites several reasons for this, including Altman's close ties to the tech industry, his lack of experience in government, and his past statements about AI regulation.

The article begins by discussing Altman's close ties to the tech industry. Altman is a former president of Y Combinator, a venture capital firm that has invested in many of the most successful tech companies in the world. He is also a co-founder of OpenAI, a non-profit research company that is developing artificial general intelligence. These ties to the tech industry could lead Altman to be biased in favor of the tech industry when it comes to AI regulation.

The article then discusses Altman's lack of experience in government. Altman has never held elected office or worked in a government agency. This lack of experience could make it difficult for him to understand the complexities of AI regulation and the needs of the public.

Finally, the article discusses Altman's past statements about AI regulation. In 2018, Altman said that he was "not a fan" of AI regulation. He also said that he believed that AI regulation would stifle innovation. These statements suggest that Altman is not open to the idea of AI regulation, which could make him an ineffective advocate for regulation.

In conclusion, the article argues that Sam Altman is not the right person to ask about AI regulation. Altman's close ties to the tech industry, his lack of experience in government, and his past statements about AI regulation make him an unlikely advocate for regulation.
