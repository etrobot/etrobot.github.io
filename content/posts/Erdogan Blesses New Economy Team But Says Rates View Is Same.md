Erdogan Appoints New Economy Team, But Says Rates View Remains the Same

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appointed a new central bank governor and other economic officials on Saturday, but he said his view on interest rates remains the same.

Erdogan has long argued that high interest rates cause inflation, and he has resisted calls from economists and investors to raise rates to combat rising prices.

The new central bank governor, Sahap Kavcıoğlu, is a former economy minister who is seen as a close ally of Erdogan.

Kavcıoğlu said in a statement that he will "continue the policies of our President" and that "we will not make any changes to our monetary policy."

The Turkish lira has lost about 40% of its value against the dollar in the past year, and inflation is at a 19-year high.

Economists warn that Turkey's economy is headed for a recession if Erdogan does not change his economic policies.

Here are some additional thoughts on the article:

* Erdogan's decision to appoint a new central bank governor is a sign that he is willing to make some changes to his economic team. However, his statement that he will not change his monetary policy suggests that he is not willing to make the fundamental changes that are needed to address Turkey's economic problems.
* Turkey's economy is in a very difficult position. Inflation is high, the lira is weak, and the country is facing a number of other economic challenges. If Erdogan does not change his economic policies, Turkey's economy is likely to experience a recession.
