## China Urges US to Stabilize Ties in Call

Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang called on US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to stabilize ties between the two countries in a phone call on Wednesday. Qin said that China and the US should "work together to address common challenges" and "avoid conflict and confrontation." Blinken said that the US is "ready to compete with China" but that it does not want to "conflict with China." The call comes amid rising tensions between the two countries over a number of issues, including trade, Taiwan, and human rights.

Overall, the call between Qin and Blinken was seen as a positive step by some observers, as it showed that the two countries are still willing to engage in dialogue. However, it remains to be seen whether the two countries will be able to overcome their differences and stabilize their relationship.

**Here are some of the key takeaways from the call:**

* China and the US need to work together to address common challenges, such as climate change and nuclear proliferation.
* The two countries should avoid conflict and confrontation.
* The US is ready to compete with China, but it does not want to conflict with China.

It remains to be seen whether the two countries will be able to overcome their differences and stabilize their relationship. However, the call between Qin and Blinken was a positive step in the right direction.
