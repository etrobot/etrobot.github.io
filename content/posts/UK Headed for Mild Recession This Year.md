## UK Headed for Mild Recession This Year

According to Moody's, the UK is headed for a "mild recession" this year. The recession is expected to be caused by higher-than-expected inflation and rising interest rates. Inflation in the UK is currently at a 40-year high, and interest rates have been raised four times since December. The recession is expected to be short-lived, with Moody's forecasting that the UK economy will return to growth in 2024.

The article also notes that the UK is the only country from the advanced economies in the Group of 20 predicted to shrink this year. However, it is important to note that Moody's forecast is less optimistic than the BOE's May projections, which have the UK dodging a recession this year.

Overall, the article suggests that the UK economy is facing some headwinds in the near term, but that the recession is expected to be short-lived.
