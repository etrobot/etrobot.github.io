## US Housing Market Missing 320,000 Affordable Homes

The US housing market is missing about 320,000 homes that are affordable for middle-income buyers. This is due to a number of factors, including rising home prices, low inventory, and stricter lending standards.

The National Association of Realtors (NAR) estimates that there are about 320,000 homes in the US that are affordable for middle-income buyers. These homes are priced below $256,000, which is the median price for a home in the US.

The lack of affordable homes is due to a number of factors, including:

* Rising home prices: Home prices have been rising steadily in recent years, and they are now out of reach for many middle-class families. The median home price in the US is now $375,000, which is up from $250,000 in 2012.
* Low inventory: Inventory of homes for sale is also very low. There are currently only about 1.6 months of inventory on the market, which is well below the historical average of 6 months.
* Stricter lending standards: Stricter lending standards are also making it more difficult for people to qualify for a mortgage. Banks are now requiring larger down payments and higher credit scores, which is making it harder for first-time homebuyers to get into the market.

The lack of affordable homes is having a number of negative consequences, including:

* It is making it more difficult for people to buy a home, which is contributing to the rising cost of rent.
* It is also making it harder for people to build wealth, as homeownership is one of the most important ways to build wealth over time.

The housing affordability crisis is a major problem in the US, and it is not clear when it will be resolved. The NAR is calling on the government to take action to address the crisis, such as providing tax breaks for first-time homebuyers and increasing the supply of affordable housing.
