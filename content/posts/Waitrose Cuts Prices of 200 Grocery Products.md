**Waitrose Cuts Prices of 200 Grocery Products**

Waitrose, a British supermarket chain, has announced that it will be cutting the prices of 200 grocery products. The price cuts are being made in response to rising food inflation, which has reached its highest level in 45 years. Half of the prices being cut will be reduced by at least 10%. The price cuts are part of a Â£100 million ($126 million) investment by Waitrose to help its customers cope with the rising cost of living.

The article also mentions that UK consumers are increasingly shopping at discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl in an effort to save money. This is likely to put further pressure on Waitrose and other upmarket supermarkets to keep their prices competitive.
