**China Shifts to Stimulus Mode With Xi's Options Dwindling**

China's economy is slowing down, and the government is running out of options to stimulate growth. The government has cut interest rates and increased spending, but these measures have not been enough to prevent the economy from slowing down. The government is now considering more drastic measures, such as a fiscal stimulus package.

A fiscal stimulus package would involve the government spending more money on infrastructure projects and other initiatives. A fiscal stimulus package would be a risky move, as it could lead to higher inflation and debt levels. However, the government may feel that it has no other choice, as the economy is in danger of a hard landing.

The article also discusses the impact of the slowdown on China's global ambitions. China has been trying to become a global superpower, but the slowdown could make this goal more difficult to achieve. The slowdown could also lead to social unrest, as people become frustrated with the lack of economic opportunities.

Overall, the article paints a picture of a China that is facing a number of challenges. The government is running out of options to stimulate growth, and the slowdown is having a negative impact on China's global ambitions. The government may be forced to take drastic measures to prevent the economy from a hard landing, but these measures could come with their own risks.
