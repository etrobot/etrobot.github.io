According to a recent report by the San Francisco Federal Reserve, US households still have approximately $500 billion in excess savings compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic. This surplus could support consumer spending late into this year and beyond.

The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco estimated that there is still a significant amount of excess savings in the economy, which is over and above what people would normally save. This is good news for the US economy, as consumer spending accounts for a significant portion of the country's GDP.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced many Americans to spend less, which led to a rise in savings rates. With the economy now gradually recovering, many households have the potential to spend their excess savings to support the growth of the economy.

While some analysts have expressed concerns that inflation could be a result of increased consumer spending, the Federal Reserve has stated that it is closely monitoring the situation and will take action if necessary.

Overall, the continued existence of excess savings in the economy is a positive sign for the US economy and could help support consumer spending and economic growth.
