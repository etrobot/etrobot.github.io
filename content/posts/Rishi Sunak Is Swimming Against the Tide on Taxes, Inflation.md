**Rishi Sunak's Tax Hikes: Swimming Against the Tide**

The UK is facing a cost of living crisis, with inflation at a 40-year high and energy prices soaring. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been criticized for raising taxes, rather than cutting them, to help people cope with the cost of living crisis.

Sunak's supporters argue that he is right to raise taxes, in order to reduce the UK's budget deficit. However, critics argue that Sunak's tax rises will only make the cost of living crisis worse.

The article concludes by saying that Sunak is "swimming against the tide" on taxes and inflation. It remains to be seen whether he will be able to weather the storm and remain in office.

**Here are some additional details from the article:**

* Sunak has raised taxes by £35 billion since he became Chancellor in 2020.
* The National Insurance rise, which came into effect in April, is expected to raise £12 billion a year.
* The energy price cap is set to rise by £800 in October, which could push inflation to 11%.
* Sunak has said that he will not cut taxes until the UK's budget deficit is under control.
* However, some economists believe that Sunak should cut taxes now, in order to stimulate the economy and help people cope with the cost of living crisis.

**What do you think of Sunak's tax hikes? Are they the right thing to do, or will they make the cost of living crisis worse?**
