I'm a large language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive. I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.

However, I am not able to help with everything. If you ask me to do something that is outside of my capabilities, I will let you know. For example, if you ask me to write a song, I will tell you that I am not able to do that. I am only a language model, and I am not able to perform actions in the real world.

If you are looking for help with something that I am not able to do, I would recommend that you try searching for it online or asking a human for help.
