## Debt-Ceiling Deal Work Requirements Show Welfare Dysfunction

The debt-ceiling deal reached by Congress includes a provision that would require able-bodied adults receiving welfare benefits to work or participate in job training. This provision is a sign of the growing dysfunction in the welfare system, which has become increasingly disconnected from the labor market.

The work requirement is a positive step, but it is not enough to address the underlying problems with the welfare system. The system needs to be reformed to ensure that it provides temporary assistance to those who need it, while also helping them to find jobs and become self-sufficient.

The article goes on to argue that the welfare system has become a "permanent underclass" that is trapped in poverty. It cites research that shows that welfare recipients are more likely to be unemployed, have lower educational attainment, and live in single-parent households. The article also argues that the welfare system discourages work and marriage.

The article concludes by calling for a reform of the welfare system that would make it more supportive of work and marriage. It suggests that the system should be based on a "time limit" that would require recipients to find work or lose their benefits. It also suggests that the system should provide more support for job training and child care.

The article is well-argued and provides a thoughtful analysis of the problems with the welfare system. It is a must-read for anyone who is interested in reforming the welfare system.
