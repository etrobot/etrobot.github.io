## Russia's Rupee Trap

Russia has been selling oil to India in exchange for rupees, but it has been difficult for Russia to use these rupees to buy goods and services from India. This is because India has strict foreign exchange controls that make it difficult for foreigners to repatriate rupees. As a result, Russia is accumulating a large stockpile of rupees that it cannot use. This stockpile is estimated to be worth $147 billion.

The rupee trap is one of the many economic challenges that Russia is facing as a result of the war in Ukraine. The article also discusses the potential solutions to the rupee trap. One solution is for Russia and India to agree on a third currency that they can use to trade with each other. Another solution is for India to relax its foreign exchange controls.

It remains to be seen how Russia and India will resolve the rupee trap. However, it is clear that this issue is a significant economic challenge for both countries.

### Additional Details

* Russia has become a major supplier of oil to India since the war in Ukraine began. In 2022, Russia accounted for 18% of India's oil imports.
* India has been reluctant to impose sanctions on Russia because it is a major buyer of Indian goods and services.
* The rupee trap is a major obstacle to trade between Russia and India. It is estimated that Russia is losing $2 billion to $3 billion each quarter because it cannot use the rupees it earns from selling oil to India.
* The rupee trap is also a major problem for the Indian economy. The Indian government is concerned that the rupee trap will lead to inflation and a slowdown in economic growth.

### Conclusion

The article concludes by stating that the rupee trap is a "complex and intractable problem" that will be difficult to resolve.
