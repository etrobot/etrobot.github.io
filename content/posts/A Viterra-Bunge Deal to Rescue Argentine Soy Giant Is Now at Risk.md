A deal to rescue Vicentin, one of the world's largest soybean meal suppliers, is in jeopardy due to court delays and Argentina's worst drought in living memory.

The deal, which would have seen Viterra and Bunge take over Vicentin's operations, was announced in March. However, the deal has been delayed by court challenges from creditors and a lack of funding.

The drought has also made it more difficult for Vicentin to sell its products, which could further delay the deal. If the deal falls apart, it could have a significant impact on the global soybean meal market.

Vicentin filed for bankruptcy in 2019 after years of financial problems. The company owes creditors more than $1 billion.

The drought has caused crop yields to fall by up to 50% in some parts of Argentina. This has made it more difficult for Vicentin to sell its products and generate revenue.

If the deal falls apart, it could lead to the liquidation of Vicentin, which would have a significant impact on the global soybean meal market.

The article also quotes a director of Vicentin, who said that the company is "fearing collapse" as it awaits a ruling on its bankruptcy.

The deal to rescue Vicentin is a complex one, and it is not clear if it will be able to be completed. However, the stakes are high, as the deal could have a significant impact on the global soybean meal market.
