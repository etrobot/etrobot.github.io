## US Can't Depend on Ukraine Coalition to Stop China

In a recent article for Bloomberg, Niall Ferguson argues that the US cannot depend on the coalition that has been formed to stop Russia in Ukraine to also stop China. Ferguson says that the coalition is too weak and divided to effectively confront China. He also says that China is a much more formidable opponent than Russia. Ferguson argues that the US needs to build a new coalition to stop China, one that includes countries like India, Japan, and Australia.

Here are some additional details about the key points:

* **The coalition is too weak and divided.** The coalition that has been formed to stop Russia in Ukraine is made up of countries that have different interests and priorities. Some countries, like the US and the UK, are more interested in containing Russia, while others, like Germany and France, are more interested in finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict. This division makes it difficult for the coalition to take decisive action.
* **China is a much more formidable opponent than Russia.** China is a much larger and more powerful country than Russia. It has a much larger economy, a much larger military, and a much larger population. This makes China a much more difficult opponent to defeat.
* **The US needs to build a new coalition to stop China.** Ferguson argues that the US needs to build a new coalition to stop China, one that includes countries like India, Japan, and Australia. These countries are all concerned about China's rise, and they all have an interest in containing China. Ferguson believes that these countries can work together to build a stronger coalition that can effectively confront China.

Ferguson's argument is timely and important. The US is facing a new challenge from China, and it needs to find a way to meet that challenge. Ferguson's proposal for a new coalition is a good starting point, but it is only a starting point. The US and its allies will need to work together to build a strong and effective coalition that can deter China from taking aggressive actions.
