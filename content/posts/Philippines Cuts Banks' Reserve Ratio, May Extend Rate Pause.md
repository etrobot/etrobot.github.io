The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) of banks by 250 basis points to 9.5%, effective June 30. The RRR cut is expected to free up about PHP100 billion in liquidity for banks, which they can use to lend to businesses and consumers. The BSP also said that it may extend its rate pause until the end of the year, as inflation remains within its target range.

The RRR cut is the first since December 2020. The BSP has been gradually easing monetary policy since last year, as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. The BSP's decision to cut the RRR is a sign of its confidence in the economy. The BSP also said that it will continue to monitor inflation and other economic conditions, and will adjust monetary policy as needed.

The RRR cut is a positive development for the Philippine economy. It will help to boost lending and economic activity. The BSP's decision to extend its rate pause is also positive, as it will help to keep interest rates low and support economic growth.

Here are some of the benefits of the RRR cut:

* Increased lending: Banks will have more money to lend to businesses and consumers, which will help to boost economic activity.
* Lower interest rates: The BSP's decision to extend its rate pause will help to keep interest rates low, which will make it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow money.
* Stronger economy: The combination of increased lending and lower interest rates is likely to lead to a stronger economy.

The RRR cut is a welcome development for the Philippine economy. It is a sign of the BSP's confidence in the economy and its commitment to supporting economic growth.
