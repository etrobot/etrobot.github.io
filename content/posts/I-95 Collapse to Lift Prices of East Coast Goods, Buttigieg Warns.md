## I-95 Collapse in Philadelphia Disrupts East Coast Economy

A section of Interstate 95 in Philadelphia collapsed on Sunday, June 12, 2023. The collapse closed a major artery for goods and commuters, and is expected to have a significant impact on the East Coast economy.

The section of I-95 that collapsed was a six-lane section of the highway that carried an average of 160,000 vehicles a day. The collapse was caused by a sinkhole that formed under the highway. The sinkhole was caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rains and aging infrastructure.

The closure of I-95 has caused major traffic disruptions in the Philadelphia area. The closure has also led to higher prices for goods and services in the area. The closure of I-95 is expected to last for several weeks.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg warned that the collapse could lead to higher prices for goods on the East Coast. He said that the closure of I-95 is a reminder of the importance of infrastructure investment, and the need to make our roads and bridges more resilient to climate change and other threats.

The collapse of I-95 is a major transportation disruption that is having a significant impact on the East Coast economy. The closure of the highway is expected to lead to higher prices for goods and services, and it is a reminder of the importance of infrastructure investment.
