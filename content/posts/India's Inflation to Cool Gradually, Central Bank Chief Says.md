## India's Inflation to Cool Gradually

India's inflation is expected to cool gradually from October, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said. The central bank has raised interest rates by 90 basis points in the last two months in an attempt to control inflation. Das said that the central bank's goal is to ensure a "soft landing" for the economy, meaning that inflation comes down without causing a recession. He also said that the supply outlook for India is favorable, which should help to cool inflation.

Overall, the article suggests that India's inflation is likely to peak in the coming months and then start to decline. However, it is still too early to say for sure when inflation will return to the central bank's target of 4%.

**Here are some additional details from the article:**

* Inflation in India has been rising sharply in recent months, driven by rising food and fuel prices.
* The war in Ukraine has exacerbated the problem, as it has led to higher global commodity prices.
* The central bank has raised interest rates in an attempt to cool inflation, but it is too early to say whether this will be effective.
* Das said that the central bank is "watching the situation closely" and will take further action if necessary.

**The article concludes by saying that the Indian economy is still growing, but inflation is a major concern for policymakers. The central bank is hoping to bring inflation under control without causing a recession, but it remains to be seen whether this will be possible.**
