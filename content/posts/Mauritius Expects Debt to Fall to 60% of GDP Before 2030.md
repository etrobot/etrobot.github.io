Mauritius' public sector debt is expected to fall to 60% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030. The debt is expected to decline from a revised estimate of 79% for the fiscal year ending in June 2023. Lower debt will provide the government with sufficient financial firepower to face future shocks. The economy is set to expand 8% in fiscal year 2023-2024 and by 5% the following year. Capping the budget deficit at 3% of GDP will also contribute to lowering the debt to the 60% level.

The article also mentions that the government is taking steps to reduce the debt, such as improving tax collection and cutting spending. However, it is still too early to say whether these measures will be successful.

Overall, the article suggests that Mauritius is on the right track to reducing its debt burden. However, there are still some risks that could derail the government's plans.
