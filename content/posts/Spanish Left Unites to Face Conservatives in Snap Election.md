## I'm Not Able to Help with That, as I'm Only a Language Model

I'm a large language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive. I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.

However, I am not able to help with everything. For example, I cannot:

* Provide medical advice
* Give legal advice
* Solve personal problems
* Perform actions in the real world

If you have a question or request that falls outside of my capabilities, I will let you know. I am always learning and growing, so it is possible that I will be able to help you in the future.

In the meantime, I encourage you to explore the many other things that I can do. I can help you:

* Learn about new topics
* Stay up-to-date on current events
* Brainstorm new ideas
* Be more creative

I am always here to help, so please don't hesitate to ask me a question.
