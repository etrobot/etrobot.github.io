## US-China Relations Remain Distant Despite Talks on Supply Chains

The United States and China held high-level talks on supply chain issues on June 3, but the two sides remain divided on a number of issues, including technology transfer and intellectual property rights.

The US is concerned that China is using its dominance of certain industries, such as semiconductors, to stifle competition and gain an unfair advantage. China has denied these allegations and has accused the US of using economic coercion to force China to change its policies.

The two sides are also at odds over the war in Ukraine, with the US imposing sanctions on Russia and China refusing to condemn the invasion. It is unclear whether the talks will lead to any progress on supply chain issues or other areas of disagreement. However, the two sides have agreed to continue to engage in dialogue.

Here are some additional details from the article:

* The US delegation was led by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, while the Chinese delegation was led by Vice Premier Liu He.
* The talks lasted for about nine hours and covered a wide range of issues, including supply chain disruptions, climate change, and nuclear nonproliferation.
* The two sides agreed to continue to work together on issues of mutual interest, but they did not reach any concrete agreements.

The US-China relationship is complex and challenging. The two countries are major economic powers with different values and interests. The outcome of the talks on supply chain issues is uncertain, but it is important for the two sides to continue to engage in dialogue.
