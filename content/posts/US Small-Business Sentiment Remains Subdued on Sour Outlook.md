## US Small-Business Sentiment Remains Subdued

Small business sentiment in the United States remained subdued in May 2023, with the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Small Business Optimism Index ticking up to 89.4 from an April reading of 89.

The NFIB index has been below 90 since January 2013, and the May reading was the lowest since July 2022.

The decline in small business sentiment was driven by a number of factors, including rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages.

Small business owners are also concerned about the potential for a recession, with 37% of respondents saying they believe the economy will enter a recession in the next year.

The subdued small business sentiment is a sign of the economic challenges facing the United States, and it could lead to slower economic growth in the coming months.

### What is the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index?

The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index is a monthly survey of small business owners. The index measures sentiment about current business conditions and expectations for the future.

The index has been a leading indicator of economic growth, and it has been declining since January 2023.

### What does the decline in the index mean?

The decline in the index is a sign that small business owners are becoming more pessimistic about the economy.

This pessimism could lead to slower economic growth in the coming months.

### What can be done to improve small business sentiment?

There are a number of things that can be done to improve small business sentiment, including:

* Addressing the issue of rising inflation
* Reducing supply chain disruptions
* Addressing the labor shortage
* Providing tax breaks and other incentives to small businesses

By taking these steps, the government can help to boost small business sentiment and create a more favorable environment for economic growth.
