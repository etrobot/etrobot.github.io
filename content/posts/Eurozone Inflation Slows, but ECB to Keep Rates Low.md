## Eurozone Inflation Slows, but ECB to Keep Rates Low

Inflation in the eurozone slowed to 3.0% in May from 3.5% in April, but the European Central Bank (ECB) is likely to keep interest rates low for now.

The ECB has said that it will keep rates low until at least the end of 2023, even if inflation falls below its target of 2%. The ECB is concerned about the impact of higher interest rates on the region's economic recovery.

The ECB is also concerned about the risk of a "fragmentation" in the eurozone bond market, where some countries' borrowing costs could rise sharply compared to others. The ECB has said that it is prepared to use all of its tools to prevent fragmentation, including the purchase of bonds.

The article also discusses the impact of higher inflation on businesses and consumers. Businesses are facing higher costs for energy, raw materials, and labor, which could lead to higher prices for goods and services. Consumers are facing higher prices for food, energy, and other essentials, which could reduce their spending power.

The article concludes by stating that the ECB is facing a difficult balancing act. It needs to keep inflation under control, but it also needs to support the economic recovery. The ECB will likely keep rates low for now, but it could start to raise rates in the future if inflation continues to rise.
