**Volkswagen Revives Scout Brand to Win Over American Buyers**

Volkswagen is reviving the Scout brand in the United States in an effort to win over more American buyers. The Scout brand was originally owned by International Harvester and produced trucks and SUVs from 1961 to 1980. Volkswagen plans to launch three Scout models in the United States by 2026, starting with an electric SUV. The Scout models will be built in the United States and will be priced to compete with other popular SUVs, such as the Ford Bronco and Jeep Wrangler.

Volkswagen believes that the Scout brand has the potential to be a major player in the U.S. SUV market. The Scout brand is known for its ruggedness and off-road capability, which should appeal to American buyers. Volkswagen is also investing heavily in marketing and advertising for the Scout brand. The company is confident that the Scout brand can help it win over more American buyers and increase its market share in the United States.

**What do you think of Volkswagen's plan to revive the Scout brand? Will it be successful?**
