## Theft Shuts Down Key Railway Serving South Africa's Iron-Ore Exporters

A key railway line serving South Africa's iron-ore exporters was shut down due to theft of power cables. The 861-kilometer (535-mile) line is used to transport iron-ore and manganese from Kumba Iron Ore Ltd.'s giant Sishen mine and other operations in the Northern Cape province to the port of Saldanha.

The theft of the power cables caused a power failure, which shut down operations on the line. Transnet SOC Ltd., the state-owned entity that operates the line, said that security teams were activated and working with law enforcement agencies to investigate the theft. The company said that it was working to restore services on the line as soon as possible.

The theft of the power cables is a major setback for South Africa's iron-ore industry. The country is the world's largest exporter of iron-ore, and the railway line is a vital transportation link for the industry. The closure of the line is likely to cause delays and disruptions in the export of iron-ore.

The theft of the power cables is also a sign of the growing problem of crime in South Africa. The country has a high crime rate, and theft of infrastructure is a common problem. The theft of the power cables is a reminder of the challenges that South Africa faces in maintaining its infrastructure and ensuring the security of its economic interests.
