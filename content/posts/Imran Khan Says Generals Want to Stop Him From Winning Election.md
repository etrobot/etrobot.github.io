## Imran Khan Accuses Generals of Trying to Stop Him from Winning Election

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has accused the country's generals of trying to stop him from winning the next election. Khan made the accusation in a speech to supporters on Friday, saying that the generals are "afraid" of him because he is a "threat" to their power. Khan also said that the generals are working with the country's current prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, to rig the next election.

Khan's accusations have been met with skepticism by some, but they have also raised concerns about the future of democracy in Pakistan.

Here is a summary of the key points of the article:

* Khan was ousted from power in a no-confidence vote in April 2022.
* He has since been leading a campaign to pressure the current government to resign.
* Khan has also been holding rallies and speeches across the country, calling for early elections.
* The next general election in Pakistan is scheduled to be held in 2023.

It is important to note that these are just allegations at this point. The generals have denied any involvement in trying to stop Khan from winning the next election. However, Khan's accusations have raised concerns about the future of democracy in Pakistan.
