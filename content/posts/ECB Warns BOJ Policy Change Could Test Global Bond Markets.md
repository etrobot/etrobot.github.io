## ECB Warns BOJ Policy Change Could Test Global Bond Markets

The European Central Bank (ECB) has warned that a change in policy by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) could test global bond markets.

The BOJ has been maintaining a policy of negative interest rates and quantitative easing for years, which has helped to keep Japanese government bond yields low. However, there are signs that the BOJ may be considering a change in policy, as inflation in Japan has started to pick up.

If the BOJ were to raise interest rates or reduce its bond purchases, it could lead to higher yields on Japanese government bonds. This could in turn lead to higher yields on government bonds around the world, as investors seek higher returns.

The ECB is concerned that a rise in global bond yields could disrupt the recovery in the eurozone economy.

The article also mentions that investors from Japan have been selling European bonds in recent years. This is likely due to the fact that Japanese investors are looking for higher yields, and European bonds have not been offering as much yield as Japanese government bonds. If the BOJ were to raise interest rates, it could lead to even more selling of European bonds by Japanese investors.

Overall, the article suggests that a change in policy by the BOJ could have a significant impact on global bond markets. The ECB is concerned that this could disrupt the recovery in the eurozone economy.
