## The EU's Grab for the Swaps Market Poses a Systemic Risk

The European Union is trying to force all over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps to be cleared through central clearing counterparties (CCPs). This could lead to a systemic risk if a CCP fails.

The EU's plan is based on the assumption that CCPs are safer than OTC markets. However, there is no evidence to support this assumption. In fact, CCPs are more complex and pose a greater risk of failure. The EU's plan could lead to a financial crisis if a CCP fails.

The EU should abandon its plan to force all OTC interest rate swaps to be cleared through CCPs. Instead, it should focus on improving the regulation of OTC markets. This would make OTC markets safer without the need to force all trades to be cleared through CCPs.

### Key Points

* The EU is trying to force all OTC interest rate swaps to be cleared through CCPs.
* This could lead to a systemic risk if a CCP fails.
* The EU's plan is based on the assumption that CCPs are safer than OTC markets.
* However, there is no evidence to support this assumption.
* In fact, CCPs are more complex and pose a greater risk of failure.
* The EU's plan could lead to a financial crisis if a CCP fails.

### The EU's Plan

The EU's plan is to force all OTC interest rate swaps to be cleared through CCPs by the end of 2022. CCPs are entities that act as a central counterparty for OTC trades. This means that they take on the counterparty risk for each trade.

The EU believes that CCPs will make OTC markets safer by reducing counterparty risk. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, CCPs are more complex and pose a greater risk of failure.

### The Risks of CCPs

CCPs are more complex than OTC markets. This is because they have to manage a large number of trades and counterparties. This complexity makes CCPs more vulnerable to failure.

In addition, CCPs are exposed to a greater risk of contagion. This is because if one CCP fails, it could lead to the failure of other CCPs. This could lead to a systemic financial crisis.

### The EU Should Abandon Its Plan

The EU should abandon its plan to force all OTC interest rate swaps to be cleared through CCPs. Instead, it should focus on improving the regulation of OTC markets. This would make OTC markets safer without the need to force all trades to be cleared through CCPs.

Here are some ways to improve the regulation of OTC markets:

* Increase transparency in OTC markets.
* Improve the creditworthiness of counterparties.
* Increase the amount of collateral that is required for OTC trades.

These measures would make OTC markets safer without the need to force all trades to be cleared through CCPs.
