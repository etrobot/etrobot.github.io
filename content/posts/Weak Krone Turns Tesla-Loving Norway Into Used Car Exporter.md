## Weak Norwegian Krone Boosts Used Car Market

The Norwegian krone has weakened against the euro and the dollar in recent months. This has made imported cars more expensive in Norway, and has led to a surge in demand for used cars.

In May 2023, the registration of imported used cars fell by 80% compared to the same month in 2022. At the same time, the export of used cars from Norway increased by 11,000 units, worth NOK 1.2 billion.

The weak krone is expected to continue to boost the used car market in Norway. This is good news for Norwegian car dealers, but it could put pressure on the Norwegian automotive industry.

Here are some of the reasons why the Norwegian krone has weakened:

* The country's high oil and gas exports have led to a surplus of foreign currency, which has put downward pressure on the krone.
* The Norwegian central bank has kept interest rates low, which has also made the krone less attractive to investors.
* The global economy has slowed down, which has reduced demand for Norwegian exports.

The weak krone is likely to continue to be a challenge for the Norwegian economy in the coming months. However, it is also an opportunity for Norwegian businesses that are able to adapt to the changing economic environment.
