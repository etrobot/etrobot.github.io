Preteens are increasingly using social media, even though many platforms have age limits of 13 or older. A recent study by the Pew Research Center found that 69% of 13- to 17-year-olds in the U.S. use at least one social media platform, and 45% of 10- to 12-year-olds use at least one social media platform.

There is a growing concern that social media can be harmful to preteens, especially in terms of their mental health and well-being. For example, one study found that preteens who use social media are more likely to experience depression and anxiety.

Governments in the U.S. and Europe are considering new regulations that would require social media companies to verify the age of their users. These regulations have been met with opposition from some social media companies, who argue that they would be too difficult and expensive to implement.

The debate over age verification on social media is likely to continue in the coming months and years. Social media companies are likely to continue to oppose new regulations, while governments are likely to continue to push for stronger protections for preteens.

Here are some possible solutions to the problem of preteens using social media:

* Social media companies could make it more difficult for preteens to create accounts. For example, they could require users to provide a government-issued ID or to have their parents verify their age.
* Governments could pass laws that require social media companies to verify the age of their users.
* Parents could talk to their children about the risks of social media and help them to use it safely.

It is important to find a solution to this problem because social media can be harmful to preteens. By working together, we can help to protect preteens from the risks of social media.
