## South Africa's Current-Account Deficit Narrows

South Africa's current-account deficit narrowed to 2.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of 2023, from 3.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022.

The narrowing of the deficit was driven by a decline in imports, which fell by 10.4% year-on-year, and an increase in exports, which rose by 11.1% year-on-year.

The trade balance surplus widened to R10.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023, from R6.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022.

The narrowing of the current-account deficit was a positive development for South Africa, as it helped to reduce the country's external debt burden.

However, the deficit remains high, and South Africa will need to continue to focus on reducing its imports and increasing its exports in order to achieve sustainable current-account surpluses.

**The current account**

The current account is a measure of a country's trade in goods and services, as well as its income and payments on investments.

A current-account deficit occurs when a country imports more goods and services than it exports.

A current-account deficit can be financed by borrowing from foreign investors, but this can lead to a build-up of external debt.

A sustainable current-account deficit is one that is financed by long-term investment, such as foreign direct investment.

**The narrowing of the deficit**

The narrowing of South Africa's current-account deficit is a positive development, but the deficit remains high. South Africa will need to continue to focus on reducing its imports and increasing its exports in order to achieve sustainable current-account surpluses.

Here are some of the things that South Africa can do to reduce its current-account deficit:

* Promote exports by reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade.
* Invest in research and development to create new export-oriented industries.
* Improve the efficiency of its ports and other infrastructure to make it easier and cheaper to export goods.
* Attract foreign direct investment by creating a more business-friendly environment.

By taking these steps, South Africa can reduce its current-account deficit and improve its economic outlook.
