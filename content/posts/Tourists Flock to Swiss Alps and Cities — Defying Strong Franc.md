**Tourists Flock to Swiss Alps and Cities Despite Strong Franc**

The strong Swiss franc did not deter international tourists from visiting Switzerland last winter. The number of overnight stays in Swiss hotels between November and April 2023 was 17.4 million, up 18% from the previous year. Foreign visitors accounted for 8.1 million of these overnight stays, up more than 40% from the previous year. American tourists led the way, with their stays increasing 88%.

The ski region of Valais, famous for the Matterhorn and Zermatt, saw the biggest increase in foreign visitors, with bookings up 55%. City visits to Zurich, Geneva and Basel also saw significant increases, with bookings up around 45%.

The article concludes by stating that the strong Swiss franc is "defying" expectations by not deterring tourists from visiting the country. This is likely due to a number of factors, including the fact that many tourists have saved money during the pandemic and are now looking to spend it on travel. Additionally, the Swiss Alps and cities offer a variety of attractions that appeal to a wide range of tourists.
