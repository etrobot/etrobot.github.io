## Boris Johnson Resigns as UK Prime Minister

Boris Johnson resigned as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on Thursday, after a series of scandals and controversies.

Johnson said he was "sad to be giving up the best job in the world" but that it was "clearly the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader."

Johnson's resignation comes after months of pressure from within his own party and from the public. He has been accused of lying, breaking the law, and mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is unclear who will replace Johnson as Prime Minister. Several candidates have already announced their intention to run, including Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, and Jeremy Hunt.

The Conservative Party will hold a leadership election to choose Johnson's successor. The new Prime Minister is expected to be announced in early September.

**Impact of Johnson's resignation**

Johnson's resignation is likely to have a significant impact on the UK's economy and its standing in the world.

The UK economy is already facing a number of challenges, including rising inflation and the war in Ukraine. Johnson's resignation could further destabilize the economy and make it more difficult to attract investment.

On the international stage, Johnson was a controversial figure. He was admired by some for his charisma and his willingness to challenge the status quo. However, he was also criticized for his gaffes and his lack of attention to detail.

Johnson's resignation is likely to be a relief to some of his critics, but it is also a reminder of the challenges facing the UK as it tries to navigate its way through a difficult period.

**Who will replace Johnson?**

The race to replace Johnson as Prime Minister is already underway. Several candidates have already announced their intention to run, including:

* Rishi Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer
* Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary
* Jeremy Hunt, the former Health Secretary

The Conservative Party will hold a leadership election to choose Johnson's successor. The new Prime Minister is expected to be announced in early September.

**What does the future hold?**

The future of the UK is uncertain following Johnson's resignation. The new Prime Minister will face a number of challenges, including the economy, the war in Ukraine, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

It is too early to say what the long-term implications of Johnson's resignation will be. However, it is clear that the UK is at a turning point.
