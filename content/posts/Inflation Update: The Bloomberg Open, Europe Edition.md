## Will the Fed Pause Its Hiking Cycle?

Inflation in the United States probably eased to 4.1% in May, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. This would be a welcome development for consumers and businesses, but it could also lead the Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates.

The Fed has signaled that it will continue to raise rates until inflation comes down to its 2% target. However, if inflation eases more quickly than expected, the Fed could pause its hiking cycle or even start to cut rates. That would be a welcome development for the economy, which is facing headwinds from the war in Ukraine and rising interest rates.

The Fed has raised interest rates by 75 basis points this year, and it is expected to raise rates by another 50 basis points at its meeting tomorrow. However, if inflation eases more quickly than expected, the Fed could delay its next rate hike or even start to cut rates.

The war in Ukraine has caused energy prices to surge, which has pushed up inflation. Rising interest rates are also putting pressure on the economy, as they make it more expensive for businesses to borrow money and invest.

If the Fed is able to pause its hiking cycle or even start to cut rates, it would provide some relief to the economy. This would help to boost economic growth and could help to prevent a recession.
