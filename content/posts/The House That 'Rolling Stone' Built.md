* "I also wanted the house to be a reflection of my own personal style," Wenner added. "I'm not a big fan of clutter or unnecessary ornamentation. I prefer things to be simple and uncluttered."
* "I think the house turned out exactly the way I wanted it to," Wenner said. "It's a place where I can relax and be myself, and that's all I could ask for."

The house is located on a secluded piece of property in Montauk, New York. The property is surrounded by trees and has a direct view of the ocean. The house itself is made of wood and stone, and it has a large open floor plan. The interior of the house is decorated in a simple and elegant style, with a focus on natural materials.
