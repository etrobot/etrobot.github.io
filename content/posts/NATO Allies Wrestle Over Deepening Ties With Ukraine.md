### NATO Allies Wrestle Over Deepening Ties With Ukraine

NATO allies are divided over whether to deepen ties with Ukraine. Some allies, such as the United States and Poland, believe that Ukraine should be given a Membership Action Plan (MAP), which is a first step towards joining NATO. Other allies, such as Germany and France, are more cautious, fearing that deepening ties with Ukraine could provoke Russia.

The issue of Ukraine is likely to be a major topic of discussion at the upcoming NATO summit in Madrid.

**History of Ukraine's relationship with NATO**

Ukraine has been seeking closer ties with NATO since the early 2000s. In 2008, NATO leaders promised Ukraine that it would one day join the alliance. However, Russia has been opposed to Ukraine's membership in NATO. In 2014, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. Since then, there has been a war in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists.

**Reasons why some allies support deepening ties with Ukraine**

Some NATO allies believe that deepening ties with Ukraine is important to deter Russia from further aggression. They argue that Ukraine is a sovereign nation that has the right to choose its own security partners. They also believe that Ukraine has made significant progress in meeting NATO standards, and that it is ready to take the next step towards membership.

**Reasons why other allies are cautious about deepening ties with Ukraine**

Other NATO allies are more cautious about deepening ties with Ukraine. They fear that doing so could provoke Russia and lead to a wider conflict. They also worry that Ukraine is not yet ready to meet NATO standards, and that membership could be destabilizing for the alliance.

**Potential consequences of deepening ties with Ukraine**

The potential consequences of deepening ties with Ukraine are complex and uncertain. There is a risk that it could provoke Russia and lead to a wider conflict. However, there is also a risk that it could deter Russia from further aggression and strengthen Ukraine's security. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to deepen ties with Ukraine is a difficult one for NATO allies.

**Conclusion**

The issue of Ukraine is a complex one, and there is no easy solution. NATO allies will need to carefully consider all of the options before making a decision about how to proceed.
