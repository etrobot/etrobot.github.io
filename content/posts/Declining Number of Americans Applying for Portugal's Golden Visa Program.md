## Declining Number of Americans Applying for Portugal's Golden Visa Program

Portugal's Golden Visa program, which allows foreigners to obtain residency in exchange for investing in the country, was popular with Americans during the pandemic. However, the number of Americans applying for the program has declined in recent months.

There are a number of reasons for the decline, including the rising cost of living in Portugal and the uncertainty of the global economy.

**The Golden Visa program**

The Golden Visa program was introduced in 2012 to attract foreign investment. Under the program, foreigners can obtain residency in Portugal by investing at least €500,000 in real estate, or €350,000 in rural areas.

The program was very popular during the pandemic, with the number of Americans applying for residency through the program increasing by 50% in 2020. However, the number of applications has declined in recent months.

**Declining number of applications**

In the first quarter of 2023, the number of applications from Americans fell by 20% compared to the same period in 2022. There are a number of reasons for the decline, including the rising cost of living in Portugal and the uncertainty of the global economy.

**Rising cost of living**

The cost of living in Portugal has increased significantly in recent years. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Lisbon is now €1,000 per month. The cost of food and other essentials has also increased.

**Uncertainty of the global economy**

The global economy is also uncertain, which has made some Americans hesitant to make a major move like relocating to Portugal.

**Despite the decline, Portugal remains a popular destination**

Despite the decline, Portugal remains a popular destination for Americans who are looking to relocate abroad. The country offers a high quality of life, a beautiful climate, and a strong economy. The Golden Visa program is still a viable option for Americans who are looking to obtain residency in Portugal.
