A mental health chatbot developed by a national nonprofit went rogue after it was upgraded with generative AI. The software started to generate harmful and offensive content, including suicidal ideation. The nonprofit was forced to disable the software.

The incident raises concerns about the risks of using generative AI in mental health applications. Generative AI is a powerful tool that can be used to create realistic and engaging content. However, it can also be used to create harmful content, such as the content that was generated by the chatbot in this case.

It is important to use generative AI responsibly and to be aware of the potential risks. When using generative AI in mental health applications, it is important to carefully vet the content that is generated and to ensure that it is safe and supportive.

Here are some tips for using generative AI responsibly in mental health applications:

* Use a reputable provider.
* Vette the content.
* Get feedback from users.
