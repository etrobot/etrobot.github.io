## Asia This Week

Here are some of the top stories from Asia this week:

* US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Beijing for talks with Chinese officials.
* China has announced that it will lower the prices of Michelin-starred restaurants in Beijing.
* India has announced that it will ban the export of wheat.
* Japan has announced that it will send an additional 200 troops to the Philippines.

**US-China talks**

The US-China talks are taking place at a time of heightened tensions between the two countries. The war in Ukraine has strained relations between the US and China, as the US has accused China of not doing enough to pressure Russia to end the war. Economic tensions are also high, as the US and China have been engaged in a trade war for several years. Human rights is another area of tension, as the US has criticized China's human rights record, particularly its treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province.

**Cheap Michelin food**

The Chinese government's decision to lower the prices of Michelin-starred restaurants is a sign that the government is trying to make Beijing more affordable for residents and tourists. Michelin-starred restaurants are often seen as being out of reach for many people, but the government's decision could make them more accessible.

**India wheat ban**

India's decision to ban the export of wheat is due to concerns about food security in the country. India is the world's second-largest wheat producer, but it has been facing a severe drought in recent months. The drought has led to a decline in wheat production, and the government is worried about a food shortage.

**Japan troop deployment**

Japan's decision to send an additional 200 troops to the Philippines is part of a broader effort by Japan to bolster its military presence in the region. Japan is concerned about the rise of China, and it is trying to strengthen its military to deter China from taking any aggressive actions.

The events in Asia this week are a sign of the changing dynamics in the region. The US-China rivalry is intensifying, and India is taking steps to strengthen its military. The war in Ukraine is also having a significant impact on Asia, as it is disrupting supply chains and causing food prices to rise.
