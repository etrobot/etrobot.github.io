President Biden and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) reached a deal on a debt-limit increase on Tuesday, averting a potential default on U.S. debt.

The deal raises the debt ceiling by $480 billion, enough to cover the government's borrowing needs through early December.

The deal was supported by all 50 Democrats in the Senate, as well as 11 Republicans.

The deal is a victory for Biden, who had faced intense pressure from Democrats to raise the debt ceiling without Republican support.

The deal also gives Biden a political boost heading into the 2024 presidential election.

Here are some additional details from the article:

* The debt-limit deal is a short-term fix, and the government will need to raise the debt ceiling again before the end of the year.
* Republicans have said they will not support another debt-limit increase unless Democrats agree to changes to entitlement programs or other spending cuts.
* Biden has said he is willing to negotiate with Republicans on a longer-term debt-limit solution, but he has not yet offered any specific proposals.
* The debt-limit deal is likely to be a major issue in the 2024 presidential election.
* Republicans are likely to attack Biden for raising the debt ceiling, while Democrats are likely to defend Biden's decision as necessary to prevent a default on U.S. debt.
