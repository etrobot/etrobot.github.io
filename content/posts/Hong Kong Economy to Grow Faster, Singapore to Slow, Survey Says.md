## Hong Kong Economy to Grow Faster Than Singapore in 2023

A recent survey of economists by Bloomberg predicts that Hong Kong's economy will grow by 4.6% in 2023, up from a previous estimate of 3.4%. Singapore's economy is expected to grow by 1.4%, down by half a percentage point from the previous estimate.

The economists cited a number of factors for the difference in growth forecasts, including the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in Hong Kong and the slowdown in global trade in Singapore. They also noted that Hong Kong's economy is more reliant on tourism than Singapore's, which could help to boost growth in the former city-state.

The article also includes comments from economists about the outlook for the two economies. Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis, said that Hong Kong's economy is "seeing a consumption-driven rebound supported by tourism, boosting its short-term cyclical prospects." Chua Hak Bin, a senior economist at Maybank Kim Eng, said that Singapore's economy is "facing a number of headwinds, including the slowdown in global trade and the rising cost of living."

Overall, the article suggests that Hong Kong's economy is in a better position than Singapore's to weather the current economic slowdown.
