## Egypt's Inflation Accelerates Anew to Stay Above 30%

Egypt's inflation rate accelerated in May, reaching 32.3% year-on-year. This is the highest inflation rate in Egypt since January 2018. The main drivers of inflation were food and beverage prices, which rose 24.9% year-on-year.

The government has taken steps to try to control inflation, including raising interest rates and imposing subsidies on food and fuel. However, these measures have had limited success so far. The high inflation rate is putting a strain on household budgets and could lead to social unrest.

**Here are some additional details about the key points:**

* **Food and beverage prices:** Food and beverage prices are a major component of the inflation basket, accounting for about 40% of the total. The rise in food prices is due to a number of factors, including the war in Ukraine, which has disrupted global food supplies.
* **Interest rates:** The Central Bank of Egypt raised interest rates in an attempt to control inflation. However, this has had a negative impact on economic growth.
* **Subsidies:** The government has imposed subsidies on food and fuel to try to keep prices down. However, this has put a strain on the government's budget.
* **Social unrest:** The high inflation rate is putting a strain on household budgets and could lead to social unrest. In 2011, the Arab Spring protests were sparked by high food prices.

**Overall, the high inflation rate in Egypt is a major challenge for the government. The government needs to find ways to control inflation without damaging the economy or causing social unrest.**
