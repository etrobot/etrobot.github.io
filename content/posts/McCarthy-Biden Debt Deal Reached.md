## McCarthy-Biden Debt Deal Reached, Averting Potential Default

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and President Biden reached a deal on Thursday to raise the debt ceiling, averting a potential default that would have had disastrous economic consequences.

The deal raises the debt ceiling by $480 billion, enough to cover the government's borrowing needs through December.

The deal is a compromise between Democrats and Republicans, who have been deadlocked over the debt ceiling for months.

The deal is likely to face opposition from some conservative Republicans, who have argued that it does not go far enough in reducing the federal debt.

The deal is a victory for Biden, who had been facing increasing pressure to raise the debt ceiling.

The deal is a relief to markets, which had been bracing for a potential default.

### Potential Consequences of the Deal

The article also discusses the potential consequences of the deal. Some experts have argued that the deal could worsen inflation, which is already at a 40-year high. Others have argued that the deal could lead to a recession. However, it is too early to say what the long-term consequences of the deal will be.

### Overall

The McCarthy-Biden debt deal is a temporary solution to a long-term problem. The debt ceiling will need to be raised again in the near future, and it is unclear whether Democrats and Republicans will be able to reach a compromise on a more permanent solution.
