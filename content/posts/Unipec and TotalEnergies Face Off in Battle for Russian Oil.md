## Unipec and TotalEnergies Face Off in Battle for Russian Oil

Unipec, the trading arm of China's Sinopec, and TotalEnergies, the French oil major, are locked in a battle for Russian oil cargoes. Unipec is offering to pay a premium of $10 per barrel above the market price for Russian Urals crude oil. TotalEnergies is refusing to pay the premium, and is instead trying to buy Russian oil at a discount.

The standoff between Unipec and TotalEnergies is a sign of the growing rift between China and the West over the war in Ukraine. China is still buying Russian oil, but it is doing so at a discounted price. The West, on the other hand, is imposing sanctions on Russia, which has made it more difficult for Russian oil to be sold.

The standoff between Unipec and TotalEnergies is likely to continue, and it could have a significant impact on the global oil market. If China continues to buy Russian oil at a discounted price, it could help to prop up Russia's economy and prolong the war in Ukraine. If the West continues to impose sanctions on Russia, it could make it more difficult for Russia to sell its oil, which could lead to higher oil prices for consumers around the world.

It remains to be seen how the standoff between Unipec and TotalEnergies will be resolved. However, it is clear that the war in Ukraine is having a significant impact on the global oil market, and it is likely to continue to do so for some time to come.
