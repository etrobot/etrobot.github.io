## Vienna Home Prices Face Slow Correction

The Austrian National Bank (ANB) expects a slow correction in home prices in Vienna over the next few years. The ANB cites several factors for its forecast, including:

* **Low risk of forced sales:** There are few homeowners in Vienna who are at risk of being forced to sell their homes due to financial hardship.
* **Tempered supply from a receding construction industry:** The construction industry in Vienna is slowing down, which is reducing the supply of new homes on the market.
* **History of slow corrections:** In the past, home prices in Vienna have corrected slowly, rather than dropping sharply.

However, the ANB warns that there are still risks to its forecast, including:

* **High inflation:** High inflation could erode the purchasing power of homebuyers, which could lead to a decline in demand for homes.
* **Monetary and economic risks:** Changes in monetary policy or the global economy could also have a negative impact on the housing market.

Overall, the ANB believes that home prices in Vienna are likely to experience a slow correction over the next few years. However, there are still risks to this forecast, and it is possible that home prices could drop more sharply.
