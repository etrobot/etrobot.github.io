US mortgage applications for home purchases fell for a fourth straight week in the week ended June 2, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). The MBA's index of mortgage applications for home purchases fell 1.7% from the previous week, to 151.7. The decline was driven by a drop in applications for conventional loans, which fell 2.2%. Applications for government-backed loans, such as FHA and VA loans, rose 0.7%.

The decline in mortgage applications is a sign that the housing market is cooling. Rising interest rates and home prices are making it more expensive to buy a home, which is deterring some buyers from entering the market. The housing market is expected to continue to cool in the coming months, as interest rates continue to rise.

Here are some additional details from the article:

* The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($726,525 or less) increased to 6.81%, from 6.73% the week prior.
* The average contract interest rate for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 5.27%, from 5.21% the week prior.
* The MBA's purchase index is now at its lowest level since December 2020.
* The housing market is expected to remain competitive in the coming months, as there are still more buyers than homes for sale. However, the rising interest rates and home prices are expected to slow the pace of home sales.

I hope this is helpful!
