# Swiss Cash Use Declines

The use of cash in Switzerland has declined significantly in recent years. In 2017, 70% of all transactions were made in cash. By 2022, that number had fallen to 36%.

There are a number of factors that have contributed to the decline in cash use, including the rise of digital payments, the COVID-19 pandemic, and government efforts to reduce tax evasion.

The rise of digital payments has been driven by the increasing availability of mobile payment apps and contactless payment terminals. These technologies make it easier and more convenient for people to pay for goods and services without using cash.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to the decline in cash use. During the pandemic, people were more likely to use contactless payments or mobile payment apps in order to avoid touching surfaces and spreading germs.

Government efforts to reduce tax evasion have also made it more difficult for businesses to accept cash payments. This has led some businesses to stop accepting cash altogether.

The decline in cash use has had a number of implications for the Swiss economy. The Swiss government has lost revenue from the seigniorage, which is the revenue that a government receives from the issuance of currency. Businesses that rely on cash payments have had to increase their prices in order to cover the higher costs of accepting credit and debit cards. And individuals who use cash have had to find new ways to pay for goods and services.

The Swiss government is considering a number of measures to reverse the decline in cash use. One measure is to introduce a digital franc, which would be a digital currency that is issued by the Swiss government. Another measure is to make it easier for businesses to accept cash payments by reducing the fees that businesses have to pay to accept credit and debit cards.

The future of cash in Switzerland is uncertain. The decline in cash use is likely to continue, but the Swiss government is considering a number of measures to reverse the decline. It remains to be seen whether these measures will be successful.
