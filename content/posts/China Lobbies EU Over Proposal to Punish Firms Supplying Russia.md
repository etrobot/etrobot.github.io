# China Lobbies EU Over Proposed Trade Restrictions

China is lobbying the European Union to scrap proposed trade restrictions on Chinese companies that the bloc says are enabling Russia's war machine in Ukraine.

The EU is considering sanctions on Chinese companies that provide Russia with semiconductors, telecommunications equipment, and other technologies that could be used for military purposes.

China has condemned the war in Ukraine and called for a peaceful resolution, but it has refused to join Western sanctions against Russia.

The EU is concerned that China's lobbying could undermine its sanctions regime against Russia.

## Key Points

* China is lobbying the EU to scrap proposed trade restrictions on Chinese companies.
* The EU is considering sanctions on Chinese companies that provide Russia with technology.
* China has condemned the war in Ukraine but has refused to join Western sanctions.
* The EU is concerned that China's lobbying could undermine its sanctions regime.

## Analysis

China's lobbying of the EU is a sign that it is not fully committed to isolating Russia economically. This could have implications for the future of the war in Ukraine and the global economy.

The EU is facing a difficult decision in whether to impose sanctions on Chinese companies. On the one hand, doing so could help to weaken Russia's war machine. On the other hand, it could damage relations with China, a major trading partner.

The EU is likely to weigh the pros and cons of imposing sanctions on Chinese companies carefully before making a decision.
