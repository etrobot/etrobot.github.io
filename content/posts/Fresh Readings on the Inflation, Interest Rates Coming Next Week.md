## Fresh Readings on Inflation and Interest Rates Coming Next Week

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release its latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Wednesday, June 15. The CPI is a measure of inflation, and it is closely watched by investors and policymakers. Economists expect the CPI to rise by 8.6% year-over-year in May, which would be the highest rate of inflation since 1981.

The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage points at its meeting on Wednesday, June 15. The Fed is raising interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. A high inflation reading and a large interest rate hike could send shockwaves through the financial markets.

The readings on inflation and interest rates next week will be closely watched by investors and policymakers. A high inflation reading could lead to an even more aggressive tightening cycle from the Federal Reserve, which could weigh on economic growth. A large interest rate hike could also lead to a sell-off in the stock market.

Here are some of the key things to watch for next week:

* The CPI report on Wednesday, June 15.
* The Fed's interest rate decision on Wednesday, June 15.
* The reaction of the financial markets to the CPI and interest rate news.

The readings on inflation and interest rates next week will be a major test for the Federal Reserve and the US economy. The Fed is hoping to bring inflation under control without causing a recession. The markets will be watching closely to see if the Fed can pull off this delicate balancing act.
