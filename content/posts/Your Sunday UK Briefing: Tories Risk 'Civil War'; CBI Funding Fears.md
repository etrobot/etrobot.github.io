**UK Politics in Turmoil: Tories Face 'Civil War', CBI Fears for Economy**

The Conservative Party is facing a leadership crisis, with a group of Conservative MPs planning to submit letters of no confidence in Boris Johnson if he does not resign.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the UK's leading business group, has warned that it is "deeply concerned" about the impact of Johnson's leadership on the UK economy. The CBI says that Johnson's "indecision and instability" are damaging business confidence and investment.

Johnson is also facing a number of other challenges, including the ongoing cost of living crisis and the war in Ukraine.

It remains to be seen whether Johnson will be able to survive the current political crisis. If he is forced to resign, it would be a major blow to the Conservative Party and could lead to a general election.
