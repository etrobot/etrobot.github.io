## Angola Cuts Fuel Subsidy

Angola has cut its fuel subsidy, following in the footsteps of Nigeria. This means that the price of gasoline will rise from 160 kwanzas to 300 kwanzas per liter.

The government says that the subsidy was unsustainable and that the price increase is necessary to reduce the country's budget deficit. The price increase is likely to have a negative impact on Angolans, who are already facing high levels of inflation. It is also likely to lead to an increase in the cost of goods and services.

The article also mentions that the government is hoping to raise revenue from the price increase to invest in infrastructure and social programs. However, it is unclear how much revenue the government will actually raise, and it is possible that the price increase will lead to protests and social unrest.

Overall, the decision to cut the fuel subsidy is a risky one for the Angolan government. It is likely to have a negative impact on the economy and the lives of ordinary Angolans. However, the government believes that it is necessary to reduce the country's budget deficit and invest in the future.
