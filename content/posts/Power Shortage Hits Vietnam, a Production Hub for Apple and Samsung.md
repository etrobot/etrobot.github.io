## Power Shortage Hits Vietnam, a Production Hub for Apple and Samsung

Vietnam is experiencing a severe power shortage, which is impacting manufacturers that have flocked to the country because they view it as an alternative to China.

The shortage is due to a number of factors, including rising demand for electricity, aging infrastructure, and a lack of investment in new power plants.

The shortage is causing factories to operate at reduced capacity, which is leading to production delays and lost revenue.

The government is working to address the shortage, but it is unclear how long it will take to resolve the issue.

The article also mentions that the power shortage is particularly affecting manufacturers that produce electronics, such as Apple and Samsung. These companies have been forced to cut production and delay shipments, which is impacting their bottom line.

The power shortage is a major challenge for Vietnam, which is trying to position itself as a leading manufacturing hub in Southeast Asia. The government is working to address the issue, but it is unclear how long it will take to resolve the shortage.

In the meantime, the power shortage is causing significant disruptions for manufacturers in Vietnam. This is likely to lead to higher prices for consumers and could deter investment in the country.
