## Banks Divided Over Size of Turkey Rate Hikes After Erdogan's Win

Turkish banks are divided over the size of rate hikes that the central bank will need to implement after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's re-election victory.

Some banks believe that the central bank will need to raise rates by 500 basis points or more in order to curb inflation, which is currently running at 70%.

Other banks believe that the central bank will be more cautious in its approach and will only raise rates by 250 basis points.

The uncertainty over the size of rate hikes is weighing on the Turkish lira, which has lost 40% of its value against the US dollar in the past year.

The lira's weakness is making it more difficult for Turkish businesses to import goods and services, which is contributing to inflation.

The Turkish economy is facing a number of challenges, including high inflation, a weak currency, and a current account deficit.

It remains to be seen whether President Erdogan will be able to implement the economic reforms that are needed to address these challenges.
