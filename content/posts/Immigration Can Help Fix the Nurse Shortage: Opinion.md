The United States is facing a severe nurse shortage. There are currently about 1.2 million registered nurses (RNs) in the United States, but the demand is expected to reach 1.9 million by 2030. The shortage is expected to worsen in the coming years due to an aging population, increased demand for healthcare services, and a declining number of nursing students.

Immigration can help to address the nurse shortage. Immigrants are more likely to work in nursing than native-born Americans. In 2016, 17% of RNs in the United States were immigrants, compared to 13% of the general population. Immigrants are also more likely to work in underserved areas. In 2016, 22% of RNs in rural areas were immigrants, compared to 16% of RNs in urban areas.

Immigration can help to ensure that all Americans have access to quality healthcare. The shortage of nurses is particularly acute in rural and underserved areas. Immigrants can help to fill these gaps in the healthcare workforce and ensure that all Americans have access to quality care.

Here are some of the benefits of immigration for the nursing workforce:

* Immigrants are more likely to work in nursing than native-born Americans.
* Immigrants are also more likely to work in underserved areas.
* Immigrants bring a diversity of skills and experiences to the nursing workforce.
* Immigrants are a source of new ideas and innovation in the nursing field.

Immigration can help to address the nurse shortage and ensure that all Americans have access to quality healthcare.
