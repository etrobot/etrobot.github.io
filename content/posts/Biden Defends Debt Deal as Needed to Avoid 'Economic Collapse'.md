## Biden Defends Debt Deal as Needed to Avoid 'Economic Collapse'

President Biden on Tuesday defended the recent debt deal, saying it was necessary to avoid an "economic collapse."

The deal raises the debt ceiling by $480 billion, which will allow the government to continue borrowing money to pay its bills.

The deal was passed by the House and Senate with bipartisan support.

Biden said the deal was "not perfect," but it was the best way to avoid a default on the national debt.

A default on the national debt would have had a devastating impact on the economy, leading to higher interest rates, a stock market crash, and a recession.

The article also mentions that some economists have warned that the debt deal does not address the underlying problem of the government's growing debt. They say that the government needs to find ways to reduce spending and raise taxes in order to put the country on a sustainable fiscal path.

Overall, the article suggests that the debt deal was a necessary compromise that will help to avoid an economic collapse. However, it also points out that the deal does not address the underlying problem of the government's growing debt.

### Key Points

* President Biden defended the recent debt deal, saying it was necessary to avoid an "economic collapse."
* The deal raises the debt ceiling by $480 billion, which will allow the government to continue borrowing money to pay its bills.
* The deal was passed by the House and Senate with bipartisan support.
* Biden said the deal was "not perfect," but it was the best way to avoid a default on the national debt.
* A default on the national debt would have had a devastating impact on the economy, leading to higher interest rates, a stock market crash, and a recession.

### What to Expect Next

It is unclear what will happen next with the government's debt. The deal will only last until December, and it is possible that Congress will need to raise the debt ceiling again. It is also possible that the government will need to make cuts to spending or raise taxes in order to reduce the deficit.

Only time will tell how the debt deal will impact the economy in the long run. However, it is clear that the deal was a necessary step to avoid an economic collapse in the short term.
