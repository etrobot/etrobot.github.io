## France Dodges a Second Downgrade as Macron Plans to Slash Debt

France avoided a second downgrade of its credit rating by Standard & Poor's, after President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to slash the country's debt.

S&P said it would keep France's credit rating at "AA" with a "stable" outlook, but warned that the country's debt burden was still too high.

Macron has pledged to reduce France's debt to 60% of GDP by 2027, from 98% in 2021.

He has also announced plans to raise taxes on the wealthy and cut public spending.

The downgrade would have made it more expensive for France to borrow money and could have damaged the country's economy.

**Here are some additional details from the article:**

* S&P said it was "positively influenced" by Macron's plans to reduce the deficit and debt, but warned that "the pace of fiscal consolidation will need to be sustained over the medium term."
* The agency also said that France's "economic and institutional strengths" would help it to weather any future shocks.
* Macron's announcement comes at a time when France is facing a number of challenges, including a slowing economy and rising unemployment.
* The government is also under pressure to reduce public spending, which has been growing in recent years.
* Macron's plans to raise taxes on the wealthy and cut public spending are likely to be unpopular with some voters.
* However, the government argues that these measures are necessary to reduce the deficit and debt, and to boost the economy.
