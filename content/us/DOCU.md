### Chances:
1. DocuSign's stock is incredibly cheap at the moment going by two traditional valuation metrics, so it might be an enticing buying opportunity for investors.
2. Insightful Analysis of DocuSign Inc's Financial Health and Strategic Position
3. Shares of e-signature company DocuSign (DOCU) jumped 4.8% in the afternoon session after the company reported a 'beat and raise' quarter. Third quarter results topped analysts' billings and revenue expectations. Profits were also better-than-expected in the quarter, showing not only topline momentum but expense efficiency and leverage.
### Risks:
1. There is increasing Wall Street optimism the company can return to growth in 2024 after a four-quarter run of revenue declines. The software infrastructure company was downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform at TD Cowen and had its price target trimmed to $23 from $28 on the heels of a quarterly billings miss. It also received a slew of other price target slashes from Wall Street firms.
2. DocuSign, Inc. misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.1865 EPS, expectations were $0.61.
