score:-4
### Chances:
1. Pinterest, Aehr, and Polestar all deserve more attention from growth investors.
2. This mix of growth and value stocks appears set to outperform -- and hopefully makes me a lot richer in the process.
3. A growing partnership with Amazon and strengthening advertising business make Pinterest a standout stock for 2024, RBC says.
### Risks:
1. In the most recent trading session, Pinterest (PINS) closed at $36.51, indicating a +1.05% shift from the previous trading day.
2. These five stocks make up about 25% of my portfolio and are high-conviction investments.
3. Impulse purchases aren’t going away any time soon, and Pinterest stands to benefit, one analyst team argued.
