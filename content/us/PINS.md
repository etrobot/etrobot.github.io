score:118
### Chances:
1. Pinterest's partnership with Amazon and strengthening advertising business make it a standout stock for 2024.
2. The company is steadily investing in technology, such as artificial intelligence, to increase body representation on its platform.
3. The social media industry is growing rapidly, with a projected increase in global users by the end of 2027.
### Risks:
1. Impulse purchases aren’t going away any time soon, which could lead to increased competition for Pinterest in the future.
2. The company is at a 52-week high, so investors should be cautious about potential price declines in the future.
