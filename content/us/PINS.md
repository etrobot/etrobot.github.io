### Chances:
1. Pinterest reported a monthly active user (MAU) base of 465 million, up 8% year over year, indicating potential growth opportunities.
2. Pinterest's increasing user base, strength in emerging verticals, AI integration, and enhanced monetization may drive revenue growth in the second quarter of 2023.
3. Rosenblatt upgraded Pinterest to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target, suggesting positive sentiment from analysts.
4. Despite beating expectations and offering guidance in line with forecasts, Pinterest's stock may be on the verge of a rebound.
### Risks:
1. Revenue growth and average revenue per user are lagging behind user growth, which may raise concerns among investors.
2. Spending that didn't require cash payments reflected in the company's income statement may raise questions about financial management.
3. Pinterest's second-quarter adjusted earnings and sales, though better-than-expected, may not have been enough to please Wall Street.
4. Shares fell in pre-market trading despite beating expectations, which could indicate potential market volatility for Pinterest's stock.
5. The stock's recent rally may not have significant follow-through, and investors should consider potential risks associated with its growth prospects.
