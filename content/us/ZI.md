score:950
### Chances:
1. ZoomInfo executives participating in investor events could provide insights into the company's future plans and growth prospects.
2. TRUSTe GDPR and CCPA Practices Validations, as well as ISO 27001 and 27701 certifications, could enhance ZoomInfo's credibility and attract investor interest.
3. Tech stocks, including ZoomInfo, could present better buying opportunities after the recent selloff following their quarterly reports.
### Risks:
1. Fitch Ratings' downgrade of the United Statesâ€™ long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating from AAA to AA+ may signal broader economic concerns that could affect ZoomInfo's performance.
2. ZoomInfo's weaker-than-expected second-quarter results and guidance cut may lead to continued decline in the stock price.
3. The recent share price drop of nearly 27% after the downgrade by two Wall Street firms could indicate investor skepticism about ZoomInfo's short-term prospects.
