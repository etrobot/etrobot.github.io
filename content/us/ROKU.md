### Chances:
1. Roku's second-quarter results exceeded Wall Street estimates by a huge margin, indicating strong performance.
2. The current price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 4.2 is much lower than Roku's historical average of 10.7, suggesting potential growth.
3. The ad market could be showing signs of recovery, which could benefit Roku's revenue growth.
4. Investors and analysts see growth potential in stocks like Roku, Visa, and Shopify due to their market positions and financial conditions.
5. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest believes Roku shareholders could see significant returns by 2026, indicating long-term growth potential.
### Risks:

2. The business continuously loses money, and achieving net income in the future remains uncertain, posing risks for investors.
3. Roku's revenue heavily relies on the advertising market, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in the industry.
4. Roku faces challenges from streaming competitors and the harsh economics of the emerging streaming industry.
5. Deutsche Bank downgraded Qualcomm, which may have a potential impact on the broader market sentiment and Roku as well.
