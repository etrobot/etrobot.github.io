### Chances:
1. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported net income of $35.91 billion for the second quarter, boosted by stock holdings such as Apple.
2. Tech giant is working on compressing language models to run efficiently on iPhones and iPads, which could benefit Apple's ecosystem.
3. Warren Buffett, known for making good long-term investments, holds Apple in his portfolio, indicating potential value in the stock.
4. Despite recent declines in sales, Google's victory in the antitrust case could have a positive impact on Apple's competition and market position.
5. Apple's shares fell 4.8%, creating a partial counterweight to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, suggesting its significance in the market.
### Risks:
1. Wall Street recognizes that Apple may be dangerously overpriced, which could pose risks for investors.
2. Declining sales for three consecutive quarters and predictions of similar performance raise concerns about Apple's future growth.
3. Intensifying competition and declines in operating margins led to a downgrade of the stock, signaling potential risks for investors.
4. Investors have been increasingly bearish on oil and gas producer Chevron, which is also part of Warren Buffett's holdings.
