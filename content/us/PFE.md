### Chances:
1. The worldwide biotechnology market is projected to reach significant value, which could potentially benefit Pfizer as a major player in the biotech industry.
2. Pfizer's decision to make some products available only through its emergency ordering process to manage inventory after the tornado strike may indicate the company's proactive approach to handling disruptions.
3. Moderna's forecast of up to $4 billion in revenue from its COVID-19 vaccine could indicate a positive outlook for Pfizer's COVID-related products as well.
### Risks:
1. The mixed report about Moderna's vaccine sales and the deferral of $1 billion in vaccine deliveries until 2024 may raise uncertainty about Pfizer's vaccine sales performance.
2. Pfizer's inventory management steps and the impact of the tornado strike on its North Carolina facility could potentially affect its production and supply chain, posing risks to its operations.
3. The competition and updates from other vaccine makers like Moderna could impact Pfizer's market share in the COVID-19 vaccine market.
4. The ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the healthcare and biotech industry could affect Pfizer's financial performance and stock stability.
5. The evaluation of Pfizer stock as a buy or sell depends on various factors, including the performance of its COVID products, market demand, and overall industry trends.
