score:-74
### Chances:
1. Roivant Sciences Ltd. has shown promising results in its Phase 1 studies for IMVT-1402, with similar effects to its existing product, Batoclimab.
2. The sale of Telavant to Roche for $7.1B upfront indicates a significant positive financial development for Roivant.
3. The addition of Dr. Mayukh Sukhatme to the Board of Directors brings valuable expertise and experience to the company.
### Risks:
1. The failure of oral brepocitinib to meet its primary endpoint for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a setback for Roivant in that specific indication.
2. The decision to continue progressing brepocitinib in other indications may pose challenges and uncertainties in terms of market acceptance and competition.
3. The sale of an asset acquired for free from Pfizer raises questions about the long-term strategic planning and value assessment within Roivant.
