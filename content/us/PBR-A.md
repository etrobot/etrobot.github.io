### Chances:
1. Petrobras is closely following negotiations for a majority stake in petrochemicals producer Braskem SA and will be ready to act if any of the proposals go forward, potentially indicating a strategic move to expand the company's business.
2. Petrobras may further increase the average capacity use of its refineries in the third quarter, after raising usage to 93% between April and June, the highest level since the third quarter of 2015, which could boost the company's operational performance.
3. The company broke diesel production records in June and July, and the Executive Director of Industrial Processes and Products expects to hit targets again in August, suggesting positive operational performance in the refining segment.
4. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's lack of interference in Petrobras' adjustments of politically sensitive fuel prices may indicate a level of autonomy for the company's decision-making process and regulatory environment.
5. Petrobras' new conservative policy for shareholder payouts and reduction in contentious dividends may lead to a more stable financial position for the company, potentially benefiting long-term investors.
### Risks:
1. Petrobras' profits declined, leading to a reduction in dividends and causing shares to decline, indicating that the company's financial performance is susceptible to market conditions and profitability challenges.
2. Negotiations for a majority stake in Braskem SA may not materialize or face regulatory hurdles, leading to potential uncertainties in Petrobras' expansion plans and strategic investments.
3. An increase in the average capacity use of refineries could be subject to market demand fluctuations and challenges in the oil and gas industry, affecting Petrobras' operational and financial performance.
4. External volatility and political factors in Brazil may impact Petrobras' fuel prices and regulatory environment, posing risks to the company's financial stability and decision-making process.
5. The potential share buyback program discussed by Petrobras' board of directors could involve financial costs and might not lead to significant benefits for shareholders if not executed strategically.
