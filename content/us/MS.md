### Chances:
1. Wellington Management's opening of an office in Dubai may indicate potential growth opportunities and increased business activities for Morgan Stanley in the Middle Eastern market.
### Risks:
1. Archegos Capital Management's criminal fraud case and its demand for evidence from Morgan Stanley and other big banks could create legal and reputational risks for the company.
2. Proposed new rules by U.S. regulators to raise overall capital requirements for large banks, including Morgan Stanley, could impact the company's fee income and financial footing.
3. Collateral demands from struggling Brazilian chemical producer Unigel Participacoes SA could lead to potential losses on Morgan Stanley's Brazil derivatives businesses.
