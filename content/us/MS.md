### Chances:
1. Morgan Stanley's long-standing presence and recognition as a prestigious Wall Street investment bank alongside Goldman Sachs positions it well in the financial industry.
2. The company's strategic expansion efforts to focus less on capital markets-driven revenue sources indicate its adaptability to changing market trends and its commitment to maintaining profitability.
3. Morgan Stanley's declaration of a regular dividend on its preferred stock issues demonstrates its commitment to rewarding shareholders and providing consistent returns.
4. The company's position as one of the largest investment banks, along with JPMorgan Chase, highlights its prominence in terms of revenue, number of deals, and market influence.
### Risks:
1. Rising expenses remain a concern for Morgan Stanley, which could impact its bottom line and profitability despite its strategic efforts to diversify revenue sources.
2. Global economic headwinds, such as weakening overseas demand, can affect Morgan Stanley's operations as it relies on external markets for economic recovery.
3. The competitive nature of the financial industry, with players like JPMorgan Chase, could lead to challenges in maintaining market share and deal volume.
4. Regulatory and compliance issues, as evidenced by Dentons' split from its Chinese operations, highlight potential risks associated with adhering to evolving data regulations.
