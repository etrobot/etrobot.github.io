score:-78
### Chances:
1. The Fed meeting spurred confidence in lower inflation and lower interest rates in 2024.
2. Solar energy forecasts from Citi and Morgan Stanley point to increased solar panel installations in 2024.
3. Enphase Energy strengthening its footprint in the European solar market with the introduction of home energy systems in Italy.
### Risks:
1. Higher borrowing costs have hammered the makers of solar arrays, wind farms, and all the supplies they require, busting budgets and narrowing expected returns.
2. Solar industry growth in Europe has decelerated due to surplus inventories and reduced demand in crucial markets.
3. Increased interest rates and a metering reform in California have dampened the demand for solar energy in the United States.
