### Chances:
1. Kinder Morgan being one of the largest energy transportation and storage companies in North America may indicate its potential for growth and profitability.
2. Kinder Morgan's high-yield dividend stock with a yield of 6.2% could attract investors looking for higher returns through dividends.
3. The 7.3% distribution yield on offer from Enterprise Products Partners, a competitor, suggests that Kinder Morgan might also be relatively cheap compared to historical yields.
4. Kinder Morgan's ability to secure high-return expansion projects to grow its cash flow may be a positive indicator for future earnings.
5. KMI's announcement of increasing its dividend from the previous year's comparable may signal confidence in the company's financial stability.
### Risks:
1. Kinder Morgan facing short- and long-term challenges in the energy sector due to doubts about the long-term viability of oil and natural gas assets in a carbon-conscious world.
2. Significantly high institutional ownership implies that Kinder Morgan's stock price may be sensitive to their trading decisions, potentially leading to increased volatility.
3. A 32% year-over-year decrease in revenue and lower contributions from Product Pipelines could pose risks to Kinder Morgan's financial performance.
4. The past tainted image of Kinder Morgan after cutting its dividend in response to the oil and gas crash of 2015 could affect investor sentiment.
5. Kinder Morgan's stock being affected by the broader trends in the energy industry and underlying factors like oil prices and energy demand.
