### Chances:
1. Delta Air Lines could benefit from the rise in international travel demand as more Americans are opting for longer journeys overseas.
2. Strong leisure travel demand is positive for U.S. airlines, including Delta Air Lines, as the market begins to recover from notable losses.
3. Despite challenges in the airline industry, Delta Air Lines may see increased demand in the summer season as Americans gear up for vacations and travel.
### Risks:
1. The airline industry is still facing challenges, including incidents of verbal abuse and violence on flights, which could impact passenger sentiment and safety concerns.
2. A slowdown in travel demand during the summer season, as indicated by Expedia's revenue miss, could also affect airlines, including Delta Air Lines.
3. Corporate travel demand is still not back in full force, which may require airlines like Delta Air Lines to restructure their networks to account for fewer passengers.
