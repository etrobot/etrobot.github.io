3. Potential acquisition talks with KKR & Co Inc to sell book publisher Simon & Schuster for $1.65 billion could have positive implications for Paramount Global's financial status.
4. The recombination of CBS and Viacom into Paramount Global creates a global media conglomerate, offering growth opportunities.
