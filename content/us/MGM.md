3. MGM Resorts announced the transition of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas to the company's award-winning MGM Rewards loyalty program, enhancing customer loyalty and engagement.
4. Hyatt's second-quarter 2023 results, likely to reflect solid leisure, business, and group travel demand, may have a positive impact on MGM Resorts' performance.
