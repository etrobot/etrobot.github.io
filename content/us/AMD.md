score:-15
### Chances:
1. The White House's announcement of the first grant for semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. is a positive catalyst for chip stocks.
2. Analysts believe that Nvidia Corporation controls roughly 80% of the AI chip market, but its rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc, are making significant efforts to catch up.
3. The PHLX Semiconductor index advanced about 3% on Monday afternoon, with Broadcom being the S&P 500's second-best performer.
4. Global hedge funds went on a stock-buying spree just ahead of a U.S. jobs report that drove the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to their highest closing levels since early 2022, indicating positive market sentiment.
### Risks:
1. Oracle's fiscal second-quarter revenue missed expectations, raising concerns about the company's slowing growth in the cloud computing business.
2. High-flying semiconductor stocks could struggle to meet Wall Street's lofty expectations, suggesting potential downside risks.
3. Investors are digesting the November CPI report, which is the last reading the Federal Reserve will receive ahead of its final interest rate meeting of the year, creating uncertainty in the market.
4. While Nvidia reported strong revenue and net income, its rivals are intensifying their efforts to compete in the AI chip market, potentially posing a challenge to Nvidia's market dominance.
