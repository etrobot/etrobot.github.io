### Chances:
1. Icahn Enterprises' second-quarter financial results announcement may attract investor interest.
2. The company's decision to wind down bets on the stock market's collapse might mitigate potential losses.
3. Icahn Enterprises' victory in court against allegations related to Google's antitrust case could boost investor confidence.
4. The cut in Icahn Enterprises' dividend might lead to cost savings and improved financial performance.
5. The 12% annualized yield on Icahn Enterprises' reduced dividend may still be attractive to some investors.
### Risks:
1. Shares of Icahn Enterprises tumbling after cutting its dividend in response to criticism from Hindenburg Research.

3. Icahn Enterprises' shares being held primarily by activist investor Carl Icahn may lead to increased volatility.
4. A 40% pay hike demand by UAW for factory workers at GM, Ford, and Stellantis might affect the company's labor costs.
