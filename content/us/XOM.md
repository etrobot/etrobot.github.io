### Chances:
1. Oil prices are experiencing a winning streak, aided by Saudi Arabia's decision to continue curtailing its production, which could positively impact Exxon Mobil's revenue.
2. Exxon Mobil's insider activity has been observed, with a significant insider purchase of nearly $50 million in shares, indicating potential confidence in the company's prospects.
3. The company is being featured in research reports and analyst blogs, which could attract investor attention and potentially influence the stock's performance.
### Risks:
1. The oil and energy industry can be volatile, and Exxon Mobil's financial performance may be influenced by fluctuations in oil prices and market conditions.
2. Exxon Mobil's plan to get into the lithium business has been questioned, and any unsuccessful ventures may impact the company's financials and stock performance.
3. Investors should carefully consider the risks associated with longer-term option trades and the potential impact of oil price changes on the stock.
