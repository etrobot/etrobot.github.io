### Chances:
1. The FCC approval of the merger between Dish Network and EchoStar is a positive development for the company, easing debt worries and reuniting the telecom empire to tackle growing competition.
2. Dish Network's expansion beyond satellite TV into streaming TV and mobile telecom services shows potential for growth and competitive positioning in the market.
### Risks:
1. Dish Network faces stiff competition from larger U.S. carriers like AT&T and Verizon Communications, which could impact its market share and growth prospects.
2. The company has massive bills coming due, leading to potential financial strain and the possibility of a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.
