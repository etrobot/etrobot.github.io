score:92
### Chances:
1. DISH Media's partnership with BrightLine to introduce interactive ad units on SLING TV is a positive move in leveraging advanced advertising products for better engagement and revenue generation.
2. The approval of the merger between Dish Network and EchoStar by the FCC is a significant development that will ease debt worries and allow the company to tackle competition from larger U.S. carriers.
### Risks:
1. The media industry is highly competitive, and Dish Network faces stiff competition from larger rivals in the market, which could impact its growth and market share.
2. The company has significant bills coming due, and the potential of a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing poses a risk to its financial stability.
