### Chances:
1. DISH Network Corp. is poised to benefit from its recent partnership with BrightLine to offer interactive ad units on SLING TV, tapping into the growing trend of performance-based advertising in the Connected TV (CTV) space.
2. The approval of the merger between DISH Network and EchoStar by the FCC is a positive development, as it will allow the company to ease debt worries and compete more effectively with larger U.S. carriers in the telecom market.
### Risks:
1. DISH faces stiff competition from larger rivals like AT&T and Verizon Communications in the streaming TV and mobile telecom services space, which could impact its growth potential.
2. The company's massive upcoming bills may lead to financial strain and could potentially force it into a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing if not managed effectively.
