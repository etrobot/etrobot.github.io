score:1018
### Chances:
1. Investors should closely monitor DISH Network stock based on recent movements in the options market.
2. DISH Network's partnership with Amazon to offer Boost Infinite wireless plans to Prime members may fuel momentum for the telecom provider's shares.
3. The addition of Boost Infinite's wireless plan to Amazon Prime could potentially pressure telecom prices in the United States and impact competitors like AT&T and Verizon.
### Risks:
1. DISH Network's performance as one of the worst-performing NASDAQ stocks in 2023 may indicate challenges or headwinds the company is facing.
2. Despite the partnership with Amazon, there could be undisclosed financial arrangements between DISH and Amazon that may impact the company's financials.
3. Market competition in the telecom industry could still pose risks to DISH Network's growth and profitability.
