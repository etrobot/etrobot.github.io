score:1073
### Chances:
1. Cemex and Synhelion's joint effort to develop fully solar-driven cement production is a significant milestone and could lead to more sustainable practices in the cement manufacturing industry.
2. Cemex posted a slight rise in second-quarter net profit, with revenue up 13%, indicating positive financial performance.
3. Cemex holds around three-fourths of its debt in U.S. dollars, and the greenback's depreciation against the peso may provide some cost advantages.
4. Screening results have highlighted CEMEX as a potential stock to watch.
### Risks:
1. Cemex predicts an increase in its cost of debt by $100 million, which could impact its financials and profitability.
2. The cement manufacturing industry is energy-intensive, and while the solar-driven initiative is promising, there may be challenges in scaling the technology to industrially-viable levels.
3. Penny stocks like CEMEX (those trading under $5 per share) can be highly risky, and investors should be cautious about the potential for substantial losses.
