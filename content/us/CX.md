### Chances:
1. Cemex and Synhelion have achieved a significant milestone in developing fully solar-driven cement production.
2. The scaling of solar-driven cement production technology to industrially-viable levels could positively impact CEMEX's sustainability efforts.
3. Double-digit price hikes and a strong peso contributed to a slight rise in CEMEX's second-quarter net profit.
4. Revenue growth of 13% and the positive impact of currency exchange rates could bode well for CEMEX's financial performance.
5. The focus on bargain stocks and valuation metrics like EV-to-EBITDA could present investment opportunities for CEMEX.
### Risks:
1. The prediction of increased cost of debt by CEMEX could affect its financial expenses and profitability.
2. Volatility in currency exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the peso, could impact CEMEX's financial results.
3. Cement manufacturing is energy-intensive, and challenges in scaling solar-driven technology could impact CEMEX's production processes.
4. Market volatility and fluctuations in construction and infrastructure demand could pose risks to CEMEX's business operations.
