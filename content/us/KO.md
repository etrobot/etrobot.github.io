### Chances:

2. Warren Buffett's investment in Coca-Cola indicates it could be a good long-term investment based on his successful track record.
3. Coca-Cola's decision to discontinue underperforming brands in its portfolio demonstrates the company's commitment to strategic optimization.

### Risks:
