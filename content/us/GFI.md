### Chances:

2. The company's focus on pursuing growth by building new mines and searching for new gold deposits indicates a strategic approach to expansion.
3. Stronger gold prices could positively impact Gold Fields' earnings despite challenges related to volumes and operating costs.
4. Upgrading Gold Fields to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) reflects growing optimism about the company's earnings prospects.
5. Investor interest in precious metals as a safe-haven asset might contribute to increased attention on gold mining stocks.
### Risks:

3. The uncertainty in the economy and credit rating downgrades could influence investor sentiment towards gold mining stocks.
4. The company's strategic focus on new mines and gold deposits comes with inherent risks associated with exploration and development.
