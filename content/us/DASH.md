score:1025
### Chances:
1. DoorDash reported record delivery orders and revenue in the second quarter, showing consumers' commitment to takeout despite rising prices.
2. Strong demand for food and household essentials led to higher spending on the delivery of these items, prompting DoorDash to raise its full-year guidance.
3. The company's expansion into delivering groceries and other items could provide additional growth opportunities.
### Risks:
1. Higher costs despite a rise in total orders may impact DoorDash's profitability and financial performance.
2. Competition from other food delivery apps and potential changes in consumer behavior could affect DoorDash's growth prospects.
3. Yield on the 10-year benchmark note rising to a nine-month high and the potential impact of inflation may have implications for DoorDash's business.
