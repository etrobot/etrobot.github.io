### Chances:
1. Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc has seen a notable shift in analyst sentiment, with no analysts recommending selling shares for the first time since 2006, potentially indicating positive sentiment and optimism about the company's prospects.
2. The company has shown signs of a turnaround and recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with its new CEO's turnaround plan contributing to improved profit and positive market expectations.
3. Rolls-Royce's strong recovery in profit, driven by better pricing for maintaining engines for long-haul aircraft, indicates the success of the CEO's turnaround plan and potential growth opportunities.
4. The company's improved civil aerospace margin and increased full-year profit guidance highlight positive operational performance despite challenges in engine flying hours and supply chain issues.
### Risks:
1. Despite the positive sentiment, potential risks related to the global aviation industry's recovery and potential disruptions due to ongoing supply chain challenges could impact Rolls-Royce's future performance.
2. Rolls-Royce's performance is closely tied to the aerospace sector, and any adverse changes in market demand or economic conditions could affect the company's revenue and profitability.
3. The company's increased profit expectations could raise market expectations and result in potential disappointment if it fails to meet the heightened forecasts.
