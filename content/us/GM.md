### Chances:
1. General Motors plans to boost employment next year despite concerns over the shift to electric vehicles, which could signal positive growth for the company.
2. The expectation of offering unionized workers higher wages might indicate a positive outlook for General Motors' financial performance and workforce morale.
3. Investors are betting on highly profitable niches such as electric boats in the competitive EV market, which could bode well for General Motors' electric vehicle offerings.
### Risks:
1. The United Auto Workers' (UAW) ambitious contract demands for large pay rises could impact General Motors' ability to make sound business decisions and hurt its financial performance.
2. General Motors' joint venture with LG Energy Solution rejecting a push by Democratic U.S. senators for workers' coverage under a national labor agreement may raise labor relations concerns.
3. The highly competitive EV market might pose challenges for General Motors in maintaining market share and profitability.
4. The ongoing contract talks with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union could result in potential labor disruptions and uncertainties.
