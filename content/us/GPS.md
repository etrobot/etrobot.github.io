### Chances:
1. Gap's strategic efforts, including the Power Plan 2023 Strategy, appear encouraging.
2. The dividend increase by American Eagle (AEO) is a strong signal of the company's financial health, strategic confidence and commitment to its shareholders.
3. The inauguration of the Nordstrom Rack store in Noblesville, IN, signifies Nordstrom's strategic effort to increase its physical presence and improve its digital services.
### Risks:
1. Softness in Skechers' wholesale business, along with rising costs and expenses, remain concerns.
2. The CEO of Gap Inc recently made a significant sale of shares, which could raise concerns among investors.
3. The retail industry is highly competitive, and companies like Abercrombie & Fitch need to constantly adapt and evolve to stay relevant.
