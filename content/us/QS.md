score:1130
### Chances:
1. QuantumScape announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering of its Class A common stock, which may indicate the company's efforts to raise capital and develop its innovative EV charging technology.
2. Shares of QuantumScape have soared more than 50% in the past three months, and the company's plan to sell $300 million in additional shares could be seen as a positive move by investors.
3. QuantumScape appointed Dr. Siva Sivaram, President of Western Digital Corp., to the newly created role of President, which might bring valuable expertise to the company's solid-state lithium-metal battery technology.
### Risks:
1. QuantumScape's EV battery stock experienced a dramatic U-turn, giving up all its gains from the previous week, which may raise concerns among investors about short-term volatility.
2. The highly competitive EV market in 2023 may pose challenges for QuantumScape as it competes with other players in the industry.
3. Investors should consider the risks associated with the proposed underwritten public offering and its potential impact on the company's stock price and financial position.
