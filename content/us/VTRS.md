score:1076
### Chances:
1. Viatris has the potential to be a great dividend holding due to its decently high dividend yield, stable line of business, and disruption-resistant business model.
2. The launch of Breyna™, the first generic version of AstraZeneca's Symbicort®, could potentially contribute to Viatris' revenue and growth in the healthcare sector.
3. Momentum in Viatris' branded business is likely to have continued in the second quarter, which could positively impact its Q2 results.
### Risks:
1. Viatris' Q2 results could be impacted by foreign exchange rates, posing a potential risk to its financial performance.
2. As a healthcare company, Viatris operates in a sector with regulatory complexities and uncertainties, which could affect its business operations.
3. Investors should be cautious of dividend income sustainability, as dividends are not guaranteed and can change over time.
