score:-96
### Chances:
1. Realty Income Corp. (O) has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reflecting growing optimism about the company's earnings prospects.
2. Real estate stands as a cornerstone of wealth generation, and as 19th-century British philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill once, said, 'Landlords grow rich in their sleep.'
### Risks:
1. REITs are expected to rebound in 2024, but the realm of real estate investment trusts (REITs) has had it incredibly rough in 2023 in contrast to the S&P 500â€™s double-digit gains, making selecting the best REITs a challenging task.
2. Many dividend stocks have sold off over the past year due to higher interest rates making lower-risk investments like bonds and bank CDs more attractive income-generating options.
