### Chances:
1. Realty Income Corp. (O) stock price is currently around $53 and has increased its dividends for 31 straight years.
2. The stock has averaged 13.4% annual returns since its initial public offering in the 1990s.
3. Realty Income's high-yielding dividend should continue heading higher.
4. Realty Income Corp. recorded revenues of $1.04 billion in the last quarter, a significant 24.1% change from last year.
5. Realty Income Corp. (O) has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reflecting growing optimism about the company's earnings prospects.
### Risks:
1. Although recent consumer price index (CPI) reports have signified that inflation levels are slowly declining, inflation remains a problem for many Americans.
2. The REIT sector is out of favor, but the best names are already starting to recover. That means the time to act is now.
3. Wall Street analysts' overly optimistic recommendations make the effectiveness of this metric questionable.
4. Realty Income stock is trading near three-year lows.
