### Chances:
1. Grab plans to announce its unaudited second quarter 2023 results, indicating potential updates on the company's financial performance.
2. Grab's strategic reorganization to manage costs and offer more affordable services could signal efforts to adapt to the business environment and enhance long-term sustainability.
3. The announcement of a new waste goal in conjunction with Grab's 2022 ESG report may attract investors interested in environmentally conscious companies.
4. The filing of Grab's annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, provides investors access to the company's financial information and transparency.

### Risks:
1. Grab's decision to cut 1,000 jobs (11% of its workforce) could be a concern for investors, as it may indicate challenges in managing costs and achieving profitability.
2. The impact of raising the platform fee for each ride from S$0.30 to S$0.70 starting May 5 may affect Grab's user base and result in potential customer backlash.
3. The overall business environment in Southeast Asia's ride-hailing and food delivery market may pose challenges to Grab's growth and competitiveness.
4. Investors may closely scrutinize Grab's second quarter 2023 results to assess the company's financial health and market performance.
