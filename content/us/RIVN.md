### Chances:
1. RIVN shares surged after Tesla's Cybertruck launch, showing growing interest in electric-pickup trucks.

3. Rivian has a clear path forward and is capitalizing on interest in practical and desired electric options.
4. Search activity for the Rivian R1T and Ford F-150 Lightning got a boost from Tesla's Cybertruck launch event.
### Risks:
