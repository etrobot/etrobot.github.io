### Chances:

2. There are terrific buying opportunities in beaten-down growth stocks right now.
3. Toast completed its initial public offering (IPO) in September of 2021 and has since gone on to increase its number of clients, broaden its offerings across the industry, and lift revenue.
### Risks:
1. There are clear reasons to be bullish on this business, but the red flags can't be ignored.
2. Bank of America downgrades fintech company PayPal (PYPL) and restaurant software developer Toast (TSOT) stocks from 'Buy' to 'Neutral.'
3. You wouldn't know it by looking at the stock price, but the business has continued to thrive, expanding its customer base, increasing sales, and paring its losses.
