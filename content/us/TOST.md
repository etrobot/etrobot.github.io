### Chances:
1. There are terrific buying opportunities in beaten-down growth stocks right now.
2. Toast has continued to grow in a challenging economy, and more growth could change the market's tune in a new year.
3. Toast completed its initial public offering (IPO) in September of 2021 and has since gone on to increase its number of clients, broaden its offerings across the industry, and lift revenue.
### Risks:
1. Bank of America downgrades fintech company PayPal (PYPL) and restaurant software developer Toast (TSOT) stocks from 'Buy' to 'Neutral.'
2. The red flags can't be ignored
