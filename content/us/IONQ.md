score:1090
### Chances:
1. IonQ is an industry leader in quantum computing, and its recent MOU with South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT may boost its presence in the Asian quantum computing industry.
2. The company has increased its 2023 bookings expectations by 25% and is expecting more than 100% growth in bookings compared to last year's performance.
3. IonQ's partnership with QuantumBasel to establish a European quantum data center and its expansion of the commercial availability of IonQ Forte may drive revenue growth.
### Risks:
1. The company's financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, are yet to be released, which may impact investor sentiment.
2. As with any emerging technology company, there may be risks associated with technological advancements, competition, and market acceptance.
3. The quantum computing industry is still at an early stage, and IonQ's success is subject to the growth and adoption of quantum technologies.
