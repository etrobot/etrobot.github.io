### Chances:
1. Aurora Innovation's announcement of David Maday as its new Chief Financial Officer may indicate positive changes in the company's financial management.
2. The closing of the underwritten public offering and concurrent private placement with participation from existing institutional and strategic investors may provide a boost to Aurora's funding and expansion.
3. Aurora's release of the Aurora Multi-Sensor Dataset in collaboration with the University of Toronto could enhance the company's research and development capabilities.
### Risks:
1. Aurora Innovation reported a significant net loss of US$414.0 million in the first half of 2023, which may raise concerns about the company's financial performance.
2. The pricing of the underwritten public offering of 73,333,333 shares of its Class A common stock at $3.00 per share may affect the company's stock price and market perception.
3. Investors should closely monitor Aurora's second-quarter financial results to assess the company's business performance and potential risks.
4. The success of Aurora's business may be influenced by market conditions, competition, and regulatory changes in the technology and autonomous vehicle industry.
5. The stock's market performance may be affected by investor sentiment and overall market trends.
