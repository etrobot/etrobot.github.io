### Chances:
1. Texas Instruments has typically been seen as a safe-haven blue-chip stock, with the largest scale and lowest-cost manufacturing in analog and embedded chips.
2. The company's disciplined expansion and focus on 'mature' chip manufacturing have led to sustained free-cash-flow-per-share growth.
3. Semiconductors are increasingly crucial as economies become more digitized, which bodes well for top semiconductor stocks like Texas Instruments.
4. The company's large scale, low-cost manufacturing, and smart capital allocation have allowed it to grow free cash flow at an impressive annualized rate.
5. Texas Instruments has been a phenomenal chip stock over the decades, sustaining free-cash-flow-per-share growth and consistent profitability.
### Risks:
1. Chip investors were bullish about the industry's turnaround, but earnings season proved to be a rude awakening, which might impact Texas Instruments.
2. The stock price sank 5% after the company posted its second-quarter earnings report, indicating potential concerns about revenue decline and market expectations.
3. While Texas Instruments is considered a safe 'buy-and-hold' investment, investors should be cautious about the semiconductor industry's uncertainties and cyclicality.
4. Investors might be concerned about the company's relative performance compared to the Russell 1000 Index and the recent slowdown in portfolio relative performance.
5. The demand for high-end chips with processing power is growing, but the semiconductor industry's usage and trends could also lead to increased competition and risks.
