score:-96
### Chances:
1. On Holding reported six consecutive record top-line quarters and raised its outlook for sales.
2. Despite mixed second quarter results, On Holding reported very strong sales and growth in wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels.
3. The company's revenue beat estimates and it raised its outlook for net sales, indicating potential growth.
### Risks:
1. Earnings and revenue surprises in the previous quarter fell short of expectations, which could impact investor sentiment.
2. Currency fluctuations, especially the strong Swiss Franc, could have an impact on the company's bottom-line.
3. Cautious consumer sentiment, especially in Europe, could affect sales in the future.
4. Disappointing second-quarter results, despite revenue beating estimates, could lead to volatility in the stock.
