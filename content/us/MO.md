### Chances:
1. Altria Group, Inc. beat earnings expectations in Q2 2023, with reported EPS of $1.26 compared to the expected $1.18, indicating a positive performance.
2. The tobacco company has held up surprisingly well against industrywide headwinds, which may reflect its resilience and ability to navigate challenges.
3. Juul Labs, a former investor of Altria, is seeking to raise about $1 billion in a fundraising effort, which could potentially boost Altria's investment returns if successful.
### Risks:
1. Altria's business model of relying on a cash cow business to pay dividends may pose risks in the changing market and regulatory landscape for tobacco products.
2. The decline in cigarette volumes impacting Altria's revenue highlights the ongoing challenges faced by the tobacco industry.
3. Juul Labs, previously backed by Altria, faced financial difficulties, and the outcome of its fundraising effort may affect Altria's investment exposure.
4. Investors should consider the potential impact of regulatory changes on the tobacco industry and how it could affect Altria's business prospects.
5. The stock may be influenced by market reactions to earnings reports and news related to the tobacco industry.
