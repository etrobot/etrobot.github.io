### Chances:
1. Altria Group's dividend yield is now at 8.8%, potentially attractive for investors.
2. Altria reports narrow earnings beat and maintains profit forecast for the future.
3. Altria's demand for nicotine pouches contributes to beating revenue and profit expectations.
4. Altria reaffirms 2023 full-year earnings guidance after second-quarter results.
5. Altria's reliable dividend growth potential and high yield could be appealing to investors.
### Risks:
1. Altria seeks US import ban on Juul e-vapor products, potential legal implications.
2. Volatility in demand and regulatory challenges for e-cigarette products.
3. Market competition and price increases for tobacco products affecting revenue.
4. Mixed earnings performance, meeting estimates but with year-over-year revenue decline.
5. Uncertainties in long-term safety and sustainability of high dividend yield.
