### Chances:
1. Organon has a strong focus on women’s health, biosimilars, and established brands, positioning the company well in a growing market.
2. The partnership with Sempre Health to improve prescription adherence shows a commitment to patient care and may lead to increased revenue.
3. The availability of a new, higher concentration formulation for HADLIMA provides more treatment options for patients and physicians, potentially expanding the company’s market share.
### Risks:
1. The reliance on prescription therapies within specific healthcare segments may expose Organon to potential regulatory and market volatility.
2. Competition in the biosimilars and women’s health market is fierce, and Organon needs to continuously innovate to maintain its position.
3. The impact of rising interest rates and bond yields on the stock market may create challenges for Organon’s stock performance.
