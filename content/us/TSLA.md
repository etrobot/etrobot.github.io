### Chances:
1. Electric vehicle maker Lucid cut prices of its Air luxury sedans, sparking a price war with Tesla's Model S and Model S Plaid.
2. Tesla's plans to monetize AI could potentially boost its growth in the long term.
3. Upcoming plans for an upgraded Model 3 and leaks about the Model 3 refresh called Project Highland could have positive implications for Tesla.
4. Tesla's sales numbers in China and its progress towards Full Self-Driving are potential growth drivers for the company.
5. Chinese car component makers rushing to build production plants in Mexico to supply parts to Tesla's Gigafactory 6 could benefit Tesla's operations.
### Risks:
