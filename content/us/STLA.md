### Chances:
1. Stellantis is in early talks with officials in Canada and the United States on setting up a battery manufacturing plant in North America, indicating potential expansion in the EV market.
2. GM's manufacturing chief stated that Stellantis may not need fewer workers for EV production, which could bode well for the company's employment plans.
3. Jeep® brand's exclusive limited Jurassic Park Package launch celebrates the 30th anniversary of the original 'Jurassic Park' film, which may attract consumers and generate positive publicity.
### Risks:
1. The United Auto Workers (UAW) union is pressing for substantial wage increases and other demands in contract talks with Stellantis and other automakers, which could potentially increase labor costs.
2. The EV market has become extremely competitive, and while Stellantis is exploring electric boats, success in such niches might be uncertain and subject to market dynamics.
3. Union leader Shawn Fain's demands for ambitious benefit increases and defined-benefit pensions for all workers may impact Stellantis' financials and cost structure.
4. The widening gulf between labor's priorities and the companies' stance in contract talks could lead to prolonged negotiations and labor disputes.
