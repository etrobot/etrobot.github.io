2. Go Addressable and Advertiser Perceptions released findings on the growth and adoption of addressable advertising, which could indicate potential opportunities for Comcast in the advertising market.
3. Comcast's movie 'Oppenheimer' achieved a domestic box office of $46.2 million, contributing to the company's entertainment segment revenues.
4. Rosenblatt upgraded Pinterest to Buy and mentioned that the company is 'leaning into building better ad tools and employing better AI engines,' which could signal potential synergies or collaboration opportunities for Comcast.
