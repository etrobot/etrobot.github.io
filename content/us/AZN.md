### Chances:
1. AstraZeneca's acquisition of Icosavax for $1.1 billion signals its strong interest in expanding its reach into cutting-edge vaccine technology with Icosavax's innovative vaccine platform.
2. The deal will provide AstraZeneca with a combination shot aimed at two respiratory viruses, which could be a significant opportunity for the company's infectious disease division.
3. The potential vaccine candidate, IVX-A12, would compete with approved RSV shots from GSK and Pfizer, and potentially one from Moderna, indicating a strong growth potential for AstraZeneca in the vaccines market.
### Risks:
1. Patients who stopped taking Eli Lilly's weight-loss drug for over a year slowly started to regain their lost weight, indicating potential challenges in the weight-loss drug market for AstraZeneca.
2. Google's loss in an antitrust case over the market power of its app store could have implications for the overall tech industry and indirectly impact AstraZeneca's digital strategies.
3. AstraZeneca's battle against claims regarding the defectiveness of its Covid-19 jab could have a negative impact on the company's reputation and public trust.
