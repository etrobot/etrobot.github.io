score:1072
### Chances:
1. Petrobras is closely following negotiations for a majority stake in Braskem SA and may act on proposals, indicating potential expansion opportunities.
2. The company may further increase the average capacity use of its refineries, setting production records, and hitting targets, showing positive operational performance.
3. Petrobras' new conservative policy for shareholder payouts may lead to a more sustainable dividend approach, attracting investors.
4. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's non-interference in fuel price adjustments could support Petrobras' autonomy and market confidence.
### Risks:
1. The decline in profits and the politically contentious dividend cut may impact investor sentiment and lead to share price declines.
2. Brazilian state-owned oil company's stock performance may be influenced by external volatility in the oil and energy markets.
3. The ongoing negotiations and discussions about dividend policy and share buyback may create uncertainty in the stock's short-term outlook.
4. Changes in political and regulatory conditions in Brazil could affect Petrobras' operations and financial performance.
