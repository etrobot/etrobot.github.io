score:-78
### Chances:
1. Newmont Corporation has announced a significant exchange offer for its outstanding notes, indicating a proactive approach to manage its debt.
2. The recent jump in gold prices and the positive performance of the precious metal bode well for Newmont's gold mining operations, potentially leading to improved financial results.
3. The company's focus on ESG principles and corporate governance indicates a commitment to long-term sustainability and transparency, aligning with current market trends and investor preferences.
### Risks:
1. The company's exploration and acquisition of gold properties also containing other metals such as copper, silver, lead, and zinc expose it to potential fluctuations in the prices of these commodities, impacting its revenue and profitability.
2. Macroeconomic factors such as real yields and the strength of the US dollar continue to pose risks to the performance of gold and gold mining companies, including Newmont Corporation.
3. The company's dividend performance and sustainability may be a concern for investors, particularly in the context of fluctuating gold prices and operational challenges.
