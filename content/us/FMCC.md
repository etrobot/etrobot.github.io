score:13
### Chances:
1. US mortgage rates have surged, with the average 30-year fixed rate reaching its highest level in more than 21 years.
2. The increase in mortgage rates is coinciding with a low inventory of homes, which could impact home ownership.
3. Freddie Mac's Chief Economist suggests that the improving economy and rising Treasury yields have contributed to the climb in mortgage rates.
### Risks:
1. Rising mortgage rates could complicate the housing market outlook and impact demand for homes.
2. The higher mortgage rates might lead to reduced affordability for potential homebuyers, particularly for young Americans.
3. If the 7% mortgage rate threshold triggers a contraction in the housing market, it could further exacerbate the challenges in the industry.
