### Chances:
1. Wolfspeed's leadership in silicon carbide technology positions the company to capitalize on the growing demand for power devices in electric vehicle (EV) applications.
2. The shipment of a Purion H200â„¢ SiC ion implant system to Wolfspeed from Axcelis Technologies indicates the company's commitment to enhancing its production capabilities for power devices.
3. Wolfspeed's CEO, Gregg Lowe, being elected to serve on the Board of Trustees of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (N.C. A&T) reflects the company's engagement with educational institutions and commitment to diversity.
### Risks:
1. Wolfspeed's stock declining after forecasting further losses suggests challenges in the company's financial performance or market conditions.
2. The restriction on the export of gallium and germanium by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce could impact Wolfspeed's supply chain and manufacturing operations.
3. The company's dependence on silicon carbide technology and the competitive landscape in the semiconductor industry could affect Wolfspeed's market share and growth potential.
