### Chances:
1. BlackBerry Ltd. is focusing on intelligent security software and services, leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, which aligns with the growing demand for cybersecurity solutions in the market.
2. The appointment of John Giamatteo as the new CEO and the company's decision to streamline its centralized corporate functions indicates a strategic shift aimed at enhancing profitability and cashflow-positive operations.
3. Partnerships with ECARX Holdings Inc. and Black Sesame Technologies demonstrate the company's efforts to expand its presence in the global mobility technology sector and leverage its QNX Neutrino RTOS.
4. The company's decision to separate its IoT and Cybersecurity businesses and operate them as standalone divisions could lead to more focused operations and better performance in each segment.
### Risks:
1. The shelving of the plan for a public listing of the IoT business and the reassessment of separating the businesses indicate potential indecision and fluctuation in the company's strategic direction, which may lead to uncertainty in the market.
2. The company's reliance on partnerships and initiatives in the mobility technology sector may expose it to competitive risks and potential challenges in implementing these technologies effectively.
3. The association with meme stocks and the unpredictability of stock market speculation could impact the company's stock value and create short-term volatility in its performance.
