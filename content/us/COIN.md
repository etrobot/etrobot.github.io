score:1044
### Chances:
1. Coinbase Global reported improved losses in the second quarter, and its stock price target was raised, indicating potential positive developments for the company.
2. Coinbase is creating diverse revenue streams, which may contribute to its future growth if the crypto industry experiences positive developments.
3. MoffettNathanson analysts view Coinbase as the best large-cap stock to bet on in the crypto space, given its compliance with regulations and position in the market.
### Risks:
1. Coinbase's trading revenue plunged by 50 percent, which could negatively impact its financial performance and investor sentiment.
2. The company's revenue is tied to the crypto asset class, which has yet to demonstrate a sustainable everyday utility value, leading to valuation concerns.
3. Coinbase is facing a SEC lawsuit, which could result in legal and regulatory challenges that may affect the company's operations and reputation.
