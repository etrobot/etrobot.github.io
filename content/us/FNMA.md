score:-67
### Chances:
1. Shares of FNMA, also known as Fannie Mae, have surged approximately 68% year-to-date, showing significant positive momentum in the market.
2. Fannie Mae's efforts to reduce the size of its retained mortgage portfolio, including the sale of non-performing loans and reperforming loans, indicate the company's commitment to managing its mortgage assets.
3. FNMA's Home Purchase Sentiment Index® (HPSI) experienced a slight increase in July, reflecting consumers' improved confidence in their personal financial situations.
### Risks:
1. The housing sentiment survey results indicate that a substantial portion of consumers believe it's a bad time to buy a home, which could potentially impact the demand for mortgages and Fannie Mae's business.
2. The mortgage industry can be influenced by factors such as fluctuations in mortgage rates, housing market conditions, and changes in consumer sentiment, which can impact Fannie Mae's performance.
3. The potential volatility of over-the-counter (OTC) securities like FNMA can lead to rapid price fluctuations, making it important for investors to be cautious and well-informed.
