### Chances:
1. Growth in commissions and fees, results from insurance operations, and strategic acquisitions support Itaú Unibanco's financials.
2. Approval of interest on capital payment to stockholders may attract investors looking for dividend-paying stocks.
3. First-quarter recurring net profit up 14.6% year-on-year indicates positive performance and growth in the bank's loan portfolio.
### Risks:
1. Mounting expenses and weak credit quality are concerning for Itaú Unibanco's financials.
2. Preliminary negotiation with Banco Macro S.A. for divesting its operations in Argentina may introduce uncertainties.
3. Increased operating revenues partially offset by escalating costs raise concerns for the bank's financial performance.
4. Provisions for bad loans increased, which may impact Itaú Unibanco's profitability and net profits.
5. The overall economic conditions and market dynamics may influence Itaú Unibanco's operations and performance.
