score:-69
### Chances:
1. Apellis Pharmaceuticals reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2023 results, indicating strong performance in its financials.
2. Positive data on SYFOVRE's reduction of nonsubfoveal GA lesion growth could reflect the potential effectiveness of Apellis' products.
3. Equity awards granted to new employees could attract and incentivize talented individuals to join the company, contributing to its growth.
### Risks:
1. The stock price fell by 20% due to concerns about the safety profile of Syfovre, which could lead to increased scrutiny and regulatory challenges.
2. The ambiguity surrounding Syfovre's safety profile and reported rare safety events might negatively impact customer confidence and sales.
3. Although Apellis delivered better-than-expected results, the stock's crash indicates that market sentiment and investor perception may be affected by concerns about the company's products.
