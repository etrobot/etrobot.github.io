score:-110
### Chances:
1. Labor discontent is rife in the skies over the U.S.
2. American Airlines (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are likely to benefit from the projected surge in year-end travel.
3. Delta Air Lines has a program called Delta 360, described as an invitation-only service tier for its top SkyMiles members.
4. United Airlines has an official elite tier above its Premier 1K program called Global Services.
### Risks:
1. Complaints about airlines were so numerous in 2023 that the Transportation Department couldn’t even count all the grievances it received for several months.
2. Shortages of air-traffic controllers, airplanes and pilots all add up to one conclusion: Travelers will likely be facing higher fares along with more delays, cancellations and disruption.
3. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has addressed consumers' latest concerns in a new interview amid record holiday travel where he discussed skyrocketing airline fees and worries of poor pilot mental health.
