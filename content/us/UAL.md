### Chances:
1. Morgan Stanley upgraded amusement park operator Six Flags (SIX) to "Overweight" from "Equal Weight" and raised its price target to $32 on expectations for accelerating revenue growth in 2024.
2. Goldman Sachs named Delta (DAL) and United (UAL) its top airline stock picks for 2024. Analyst Catherine O’Brien sees an acceleration in Delta's high-margin segments and United's premium travel exposures as catalysts for the stocks next year.
### Risks:
1. Shortages of air-traffic controllers, airplanes and pilots all add up to one conclusion: Travelers will likely be facing higher fares along with more delays, cancellations and disruption.
2. Complaints about airlines were so numerous in 2023 that the Transportation Department couldn’t even count all the grievances it received for several months.
