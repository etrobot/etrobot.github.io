### Chances:
1. The National Mediation Board's denial of the Southwest pilot strike request reduces the likelihood of a strike, creating a positive outlook for the company.
2. Southwest Airlines encourages customers to book spring break vacations with an extended flight schedule, indicating the airline's efforts to boost travel demand.
3. Strong leisure travel demand for U.S. airlines is a chance for Southwest Airlines to capitalize on increased vacationer spending.
### Risks:
1. Southwest Airlines faced a holiday meltdown, and it may take time to regain customer confidence and increase travel frequency.
2. Low-cost, domestically-focused carriers like Southwest Airlines are still facing challenges in the current earnings season for U.S. airlines.
3. Corporate travel's slow recovery could impact Southwest Airlines' revenues, and investors may remain concerned about its potential shortfall.
4. The U.S. Transportation Department's ongoing investigation into Southwest Airlines' December meltdown may affect the company's reputation and operations.
