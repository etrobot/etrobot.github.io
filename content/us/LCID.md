### Chances:
1. Lucid Group is reporting quarterly results next week, which may bring insights into the company's performance.
2. Former Dow CEO and current Lucid board member, Andrew Liveris, weighing in on the EV maker's plans could provide valuable perspectives.
3. Lucid Group's move into China's EV market and expansion in the Middle East region might offer growth opportunities.
4. Shares of Tesla rising and achieving a market cap above $900 billion could have a positive impact on investor sentiment toward EV companies like Lucid.
### Risks:
1. LCID stock is vulnerable to a near-term decline if it doesn't strike EV-market gold in the Middle East.
2. Lucid's Q2 deliveries missing analyst estimates could lead to a drop in its stock price.
3. Lucid Group's quarterly results might reveal challenges or risks in the EV market.
4. Shifting international market paradigms and China's economic recovery slowdown may impact Lucid's growth.
