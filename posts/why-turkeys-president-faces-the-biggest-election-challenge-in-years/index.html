<p><strong>Turkey&rsquo;s Presidential Election: Erdogan Faces His Biggest Challenge in Years</strong></p>
<p>Incumbent Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan faces his biggest challenge in 20 years in Sunday’s runoff election against opposition candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu. WSJ’s Jared Malsin explains why this is one of the world’s most important votes.</p>
<p><strong>Erdogan&rsquo;s Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Erdogan has been in power for 20 years, and his popularity has been declining in recent years. He has been criticized for his authoritarian rule, his economic policies, and his handling of the Syrian refugee crisis.</p>
<p>The Turkish economy is in a recession. Inflation is high, and unemployment is rising. The Turkish lira has lost half of its value in the past year. This has made it difficult for Turks to afford basic goods and services.</p>
<p>The Turkish government has been accused of corruption. There have been a number of high-profile corruption scandals in recent years.</p>
<p>Erdogan has been criticized for his authoritarian rule. He has cracked down on dissent and has restricted freedom of speech.</p>
<p><strong>Kilicdaroglu&rsquo;s Chances</strong></p>
<p>Kilicdaroglu is a former prime minister who has been leading the opposition for years. He is seen as a more moderate and secular leader than Erdogan.</p>
<p>Kilicdaroglu has been able to capitalize on Erdogan&rsquo;s unpopularity. He has promised to improve the economy, to crack down on corruption, and to restore democracy to Turkey.</p>
<p><strong>The Election&rsquo;s Importance</strong></p>
<p>The election is being closely watched by the international community. A victory for Kilicdaroglu would be seen as a sign of Turkey&rsquo;s democratic resilience. A victory for Erdogan would likely mean continued authoritarianism and a more confrontational foreign policy.</p>
<p><strong>The Outcome&rsquo;s Impact</strong></p>
<p>The outcome of the election will have a major impact on Turkey&rsquo;s domestic and foreign policy. A victory for Erdogan would likely mean continued authoritarianism and a more confrontational foreign policy. A victory for Kilicdaroglu would likely mean a more moderate and democratic Turkey.</p>
<p><strong>The Election Is Too Close to Call</strong></p>
<p>The election is too close to call. However, a victory for Kilicdaroglu would be a major upset and would send a message to the world that Turkey is still a democracy.</p>
