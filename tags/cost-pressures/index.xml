Chances: JetBlue Airways is refocusing on higher-performing markets, which could lead to improved financial performance. Cost pressures are expected to ease and margins improve for U.S. airlines later this year, which could benefit select stocks. The company&amp;rsquo;s decision to eliminate weaker-performing routes and prioritize stronger markets may lead to enhanced long-term initiatives and financial performance.</description>

Chances: Strong air travel demand and shareholder-friendly actions bode well for Delta Air Lines (DAL). Reductions in general inflationary pressures, and the prospect of lower interest rates, are helping to offset likely permanent increases in labor and maintenance costs. Passenger demand is steadily recovering post-COVID, in both the leisure and business segments, and the airlines overall are finding themselves able to meet the travel volumes.</description>
