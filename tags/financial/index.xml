Chances: Analysts think this stock should be worth 30% more. SoFi management expects earnings to grow robustly over several years. Needham has initiated coverage on SoFi Technologies (SOFI) with a Buy rating setting a price target of $10 per share. We view SOFI as a long-term winner in the digital lending/neobank space, largely due to its focus on prime and super-prime consumers and possession of a full banking license, which we believe provides the company superior unit economics compared to other consumer finance platforms that focus on lower income borrowers and/or lack a banking license.</description>
