Chances: Sea Ltd. has the potential for significant growth in its e-commerce segment, particularly through its Shopee mobile app and website marketplace. The company&amp;rsquo;s Digital Financial Services segment, SeaMoney, provides a variety of payment services and loans, offering further growth opportunities. Risks: The decline in revenue and profitability of Sea&amp;rsquo;s game development business, Garena, as well as the temporary halt of operations in India, pose a risk to the company&amp;rsquo;s overall performance.</description>
