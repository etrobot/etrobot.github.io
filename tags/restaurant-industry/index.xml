Chances: Toast has continued to execute on its mandate to transform the restaurant industry with technology The company has increased its number of clients and broadened its offerings across the industry There are terrific buying opportunities in beaten-down growth stocks right now High growth and low risk are a compelling combination Today&amp;rsquo;s low-priced stocks may be tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s wealth-building market darlings Risks: Toast has been beaten up since coming public There are clear reasons to be bullish on this business, but the red flags can&amp;rsquo;t be ignored Investors are hoping for things to take a huge turn for the better The stock price may not reflect the business&amp;rsquo;s continued growth and expansion The macroeconomic headwinds may affect the company&amp;rsquo;s performance Score:58 chances characters count - risks characters count = 58</description>
