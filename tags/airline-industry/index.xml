The airline is looking to improve its financial performance by prioritizing stronger routes with limited aircraft on hand. Risks: The decision to cut certain flight routes and exit certain cities may result in a temporary decrease in revenue before the benefits of the restructuring are realized.</description>

Reductions in general inflationary pressures, and the prospect of lower interest rates, are helping to offset likely permanent increases in labor and maintenance costs.</description>
