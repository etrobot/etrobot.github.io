Chances: Gold price is more than $300 above the fourth-quarter average Mining stocks like Barrick Gold and Newmont have generally performed poorly this year Gold is up 14% so far this year including a gain of 5% so far this month Expansionary monetary policies translate into a weaker dollar, and hard assets surge higher Risks: Mining stocks historically have rallied more than the metal in a bull market, but have only gained 9% this year Gold declined after surging to a fresh record, indicating profit booking in a overextended price rally Investors appear to be buying gold as a stock market hedge due to concerns that economic growth will decelerate due to prolonged high interest rates Score:-48 chances characters count - risks characters count = -48</description>
