Chances: Peltz&amp;rsquo;s pressure did help spur some change at Disney, not to mention, boost the stock price Shareholders stuck with Iger and Disney over Peltz for preserving the Disney brand, liking Bob Iger, and Peltz not having entertainment experience Activists will continue to circle The Walt Disney Company unless the share price keeps going up, putting pressure on Bob Iger until 2026 The fight may not be over for Disney, and succession planning, cost-cutting, and revenue growth are urgent needs Risks: Pressure on Bob Iger until 2026 when his contract expires will stay really tight Peltz&amp;rsquo;s involvement could continue to create uncertainty and push for more changes at Disney Potential deal for Paramount (PARA) could impact Disney&amp;rsquo;s position in the entertainment industry Score:221 chances characters count - risks characters count = 221</description>

Chances: Macy&amp;rsquo;s has received an unsolicited $6 billion bid from an activist investor, indicating potential interest in the company&amp;rsquo;s value The nomination of nine independent, highly qualified candidates for election to Macy&amp;rsquo;s Board of Directors suggests potential changes in the company&amp;rsquo;s governance and strategy Despite the rejection of the bid and the proxy battle, there may still be room for constructive dialogue and potential for a positive outcome Risks: The rejection of the bid and the ensuing proxy battle could lead to increased uncertainty and volatility in Macy&amp;rsquo;s stock price The lack of a clear financing plan from the activist investor and the potential for a prolonged proxy battle may create instability for Macy&amp;rsquo;s The ongoing struggle for control of the board could disrupt Macy&amp;rsquo;s operations and long-term strategic decisions Score:64 chances characters count - risks characters count = 64</description>
