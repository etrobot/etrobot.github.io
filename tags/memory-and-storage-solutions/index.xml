Chances: Micron Technology, Inc. is experiencing a significant increase in demand for its memory and storage solutions, particularly with the incorporation of its high-performance LPDDR5X and UFS 4.0 into Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S24 series. The company has also started mass production of its HBM3E memory chips for Nvidia’s latest chip for artificial intelligence, which is expected to contribute to a boost in performance and reduce data center operating costs by consuming about 30% less power than competing offerings.</description>
