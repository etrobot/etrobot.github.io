      <description>China continues to buy gold, adding 9.6 tons in May to bring its total holdings to 1,953.6 tons. This is the seventh consecutive month that China has added to its gold reserves.
The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China (PBOC) has been buying gold since 2015, and its holdings have more than doubled in that time.</description>
